I used to have version 12, upgraded to version 17.  As far as basic functionality goes, not a lot has changed.  I understand that Swiftpage is still in the process of integrating Act CRM. My review is not to say that Act doesn't do what it's always done, it is good for that, but I was hoping that 5 years later more would have changed.  So my 3 stars are to say that Act is a solid performer, but I was hoping for more. Changing layouts is still buggy, like the version from 5 years ago. The graphics are badly in need of an update.  If I had never encountered this software before, I would have given it 4 stars. The 3 stars is for lack of development over the past 5 years.  EDIT:  The server agent for this version STILL does not start up automatically in my windows 10, and the integration with Outlook 2016 is buggy. They should have had their &#34;act&#34; together by now. No support for this version. I am downgrading my review to 2 stars.    DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE until version 19, which should come out in early 2017.	2015-03-25

It doesn't seem to support web-based email like Yahoo!, but for the price and compatibility Office 97 Professional is a very good choice.	2007-04-17

Coming from 10 years of TurboTax, I was really pleased with H&R.  Everything was totally familiar, at half the price.  It even imported last year's TurboTax return and pre-entered my data and knew which tax areas I use.  If you're new to tax software, it will lead you through all the questions and you just plug in the numbers.  I have a 16 page tax return, including self-employed business owner (Schedule C) and stock trading (Schedule D), and this program did it all.<br /><br />There were a few minor differences between the two products, but nothing that gave either one much of an edge.  It seemed like I spent less time answering questions with H&R (there's a checklist where you can simply checkmark the topics that apply to you, so it doesn't have to ask, &#34;Did you have XYZ this year?&#34; as often).  And H&R didn't pester me with ads trying to sell me other products & services.  Everything worked perfectly.  5 Stars!	2015-03-19

A few weeks ago I ordered a new Dell Studio 8100, iCore 7, 64 bit, 8 gig, etc.  Version 10 doesn't work on 64 bit processors.  You have to order an updated CD with the right patches.  I decided to upgrade to Version 11 instead even though Pogue at the NY Times says it's probably not worth upgrading from 10.    I get Version 11, start installing it and then get to the part where it wants to adjust to my speaking volume and it freezes.  I reboot maybe 10 times (slow learner) with the same results.  My son, a systems admin for a huge bank, comes over and tries to help me.  Same results.  He does show me how nice Microsoft has been to included their voice recognition system at no charge.  It works.    I try to log on to Nuance support but have the same problem Veil Lord did.  The screen says I'm logged in, but I'm asked again to sign in, except there's no place to sign in.  I'm in a loop.    I check the site for a support phone number.  No luck.    So I Google for the support number.  It's not an 800 number.  I call, wait, and finally get a seemingly young lady to answer.  She asks for all the info about my computer and me, repeatedly asking for my name although I've given it to her several times (bad sign).  When I realize I have a screener and not a technician, I ask if there is a toll free number to call (I'm living mostly off social security and can't afford long long-distance calls).  Sorry, no.    She asks what my problem is and says something like \\"we have no issues with that.\\"  I come unglued and say, \\"Well I have an issue and now YOU do too. \\"  I proceed to tell her that other people already complained to Amazon about this.    After some awkward moments, she says go to this site and follow the instructions.  That's when I realize I might be an ass.  She probably said \\"we know about that issue,\\" instead of what I thought I heard (no known issue).    I find the instructions online which tell me two ways to uninstall my Realtek sound system -literally erasing all the files, even the folders.  I try the first system and lose my sound capabilities.  I reboot and fortunately one of the three previous installed Realtek options reappears, but only one.    The second method to get Dragon working appears even more odious, especially for an old geezer like me.    I decided not to contribute my old computer and to continue using Version 10 on that.  Maybe I'll spend the money for the updated CD if I can find out if it will work with Realtek.    Observations:    It's not wise to release a new version of software that doesn't work on one of the most popular brands of computer or with one of the most popular sound systems.    There ought to be a toll-free number for service, at least during the warranty period.    Nuance should fix its web page navigation to make it easy to find the support number and to get to online support.    They ought to have an escalation process that allows a techie to take over a customer's computer to check out the installation. Dell and Symantec have worked on my old computers remotely.    They should remember how MS Word took over the word processing world from WordPerfect in only a few version releases.        I would dearly love to use Version 11 on my new computer, but I'm not going to risk screwing up a $1600 investment that I need to make a living.      My recommendation is to wait until you see a stream of reviews favorable on the installation aspects of version 11.	2010-09-28

I used Quicken 04 for years, and this isn't even close. Yes, it is totally redesigned, but poorly done. Budgeting doesn't compute income as income, you cannot set a budget for only one account, goal setting is non existent, budgets do not get saved and you can't carry over a budget from month to month.

US	48839143	R1NXPCF9B6WRNC	B0017HO06U	666111213	Still Life	Software	3	3	4	N	Y	Beautiful scenery,  But doesn't offer much else.	First with the good.  The background art is some of the most fantastic art I've personally seen in any game.  The game is set around Christmas time (In the case of Victoria, present day Christmas, in the case of her Grandfather Gus, obviously much earlier).  Delicate snowflakes fall from the sky in outdoor scenes.  You can see individual drops as water flows from a fountain exquisitely depreciated buildings, that themselves even have fabulous artwork hanging on the walls.    Now for the average...The voice acting was lacking.  In some characters, it was downright bad.  In other cases, annoying, and in other cases still puzzling.  One big puzzle is why would some characters; characters that were supposed to be European; have western sounding voices?  I am not saying that I disliked the voice acting.  In many cases, I found the voice work as pleasant to listen to as the scenery was to look at.  My issue with the dialogue is three fold.  One, as I said, was with the accents, many of the characters were supposed to be European, but sounded American.  Two, the dialogue in most cases was just plain bad.  Honestly, in most cases it was drivel.  Lastly, it seemed to me that inflection wasn't quite all there.  At times it seemed as if the emotion that was trying to be conveyed was just falling flat on it's face.    Now, the ugly.  The story was good.  You had serial killings occuring in modern times being investigated by Detective Victoria Mcpherson, these cases are eerily similar to cases investigated by her grandfather Gustav, decades earlier, in Europe.  This in and of itself was interesting.  Unfortunately (Probably to make the game longer) the producers put several inane puzzles that needed to be solved to progress.  Missions that did nothing to progress the game and used vague clues to solve them (See the cookie recipe in other reviews).  This seriously undermined game play and reduced enjoyment significantly.    To make things worse, the controls were at times cumbersome and tedious,  which became a hassle in certain circumstances in which actions must be done in a very specific manner in order to accomplish the job.    Overall I rate this game a C+	2009-01-27

In my experience, that depends.<br /><br />For example, I own Filter Forge 4 Professional, Perfect Photo Suite, Substance Designer, Bitmap2Material and others and yes, some of these companies do charge a small fee (Approx $80) when they add additional features to their software.<br />However, I can continue to use the older version and it continues to be supported technically by the company.<br /><br />My Filter Forge is updated all the time as they fix bugs and improve performance and its done with no charge and the same applies to Perfect Photo Suite.<br />Both of which I owned when I was on Windows OS and moved to a MAC OS and neither company charged me to download a compatible version.<br /><br />Personally, I think it's immoral to take hundreds of dollars from people for a piece of software and then demand almost the same amount again just to allow them to continue using what they had paid for, regardless of how long ago that was.<br />$399 is a lot of money by most peoples standards and as it happens for me, I had about 12 months use of that expensive plugin.<br />I have asked for a refund three times and each has been ignored.<br /><br />This morning I downloaded the free demo of their DreamSuite plugin just to see whether it was worth paying the additionalfee to &#34;upgrade&#34;<br />It installed fine and shows in my Photoshop CS6 Filters list but nothing happens when I select it.<br /><br />So in closing and based on my experience, AutoFX.com customer support is terrible, the software reliability is sketchy at best and the company ethics for paying customers is appalling.fee to &#34;upgrade&#34;<br />It installed fine and shows in my Photoshop CS6 Filters list but nothing happens when I select it.<br /><br />So in closing and based on my experience, AutoFX.com customer support is terrible, the software reliability is sketchy at best and the company ethics for paying customers is appalling.	2014-10-09

I found plenty that could be done if I wanted percussion and drums but the woodwinds sound absolutely horrible.  I could find one flute sound that didn't sound painful.  I was not able to find any instrument that created a soothing sound.  Now I will admit that I have no experience in making music so perhaps I am unaware of how to create what I am looking to create so I won't say the software is junk but I personally am disappointed and must have misunderstood what I would be able to do with the software.  Many of the features are grayed out so perhaps music can be made if the features could actually be used.  I just thought that with over 1500 sounds, there would be at least one soothing creation that could be made.  The other problem I encountered is crashes.  This software crashes often on my computer.  Perhaps Windows 7 isn't the preferred operating system.  For me, I wasted my money.  Luckily it wasn't very expensive.	2012-09-23

However, what they do not specifically state is that this program will NOT allow for automatic syncing with a Wells Fargo  account (and perhaps other checking accounts) as programs such as Quick Books do.  In other words, I have to manually connect the account to the program and request a download of all my recent transactions EACH TIME I use the program.

However, I'm upset that they used ZERO characters (Chinese writing). Everything is in Pinyin (Roman numerals for Western speaker) and that is NOT how people speak in Chinese. If you were to learn the writings in Pinyin, guess who would understand you? NO ONE! The tutor explained this also in the program but how hard would it have been if you guys added characters to this program? It's such an easy add that I can't believe you guys didn't do it. Also, like one of the reviews said, this isn't going to teach you everything. I'm looking at the other language Fluenz teach and there's like 5 disk. Mandarin only have 2 technically because the third disk isn't much. For one of the oldest cultures in the world, learning from only 2.5 disk is unacceptable especially for that price. Overall, I like it but no written characters and such a short amount of vocabulary compared to other languages is disappointing.	2014-10-24

All of them are super impressed that for the most part I never even have to touch the keyboard. Most of them have seen my previous e-mails and no that I'm not the greatest typer in the world and misspell words quite a bit. They are impressed of how accurate this software is. For a person like me with a reading disability. This product I would have to say is the best product on the market for people with disabilities. I have dictated this entire review and Dragon has tight every word of it with few mistakes. Occasionally I will have to hit the backspace button and most of the time it is my dictation error that I have to correct. I would recommend this product to anyone that might not have the dexterity to type for long periods of time. Or people with reading disabilities that might not be able to spell very well like myself. This product is awesome. Oh yeah I also read a review before I bought this product that said the man or woman who installed the product on their PC said it had a rocky installation on Vista. I did not run into any problems that they indicated. This product is a dream come true for me.    Landon	2008-11-18

Basically, greed kills. I had been using TurboTax Deluxe for about 20 years. You keep a loyal customer base by keeping a product's functionality consistent, with minor improvements from year to year. It's also a basic axiom is that it is cheaper to retain a customer than obtain a new one. Intuit abandoned this basic premise of customer retention by stripping Turbotax Deluxe of its long standing functionality, and trying (greedily) to force customers into a higher priced product in order to obtain schedules \\"C\\" \\"D\\" and other schedules/forms. So, in turn, I have now abandoned Turbotax in favor of H&R Block; which has the forms I want and at a cheaper price. I'm completely happy with my decision, and I intend to stay with H&R in the future. Now, in order to make the same profit, Intuit has to get two new customers; one to make up for losing me, and a second to add market share. This also applies to all the other customers that have abandoned Turbotax for crippling the software. Remember, it costs more to obtain a client than retain one. Bad decision, Intuit. The last thing any company wants to do is to push loyal customers to its competitor, since customers will simply realign their loyalties to the new company -- like now.    Update: H&R Block Deluxe works perfectly. Imported Turbotax data flawlessly (seriously, it was perfect). From the time I put the H&R Deluxe disk in my drive, it was 4 1/2 minutes for it to install, load, transfer all of my 2013 turbotax data, and start its interview/personalization process. No glitches. No issues. No problems. Interface is clear and straight forward. It has all the forms I need (just like the old turbo tax deluxe) and was a fraction of the cost that Intuit wanted for the product that would have given me the same forms. Unless they do something foolish, H&R Block gets my future business.	2015-01-01

However my support is waning.    I am very upset, since when my subscription ran out it did not just refuse to update. The program came to a screeching halt.  In the past, the only thing that happened When the subscription lapsed, was that it refused to update the av signatures.  This time it turned off my firewall, and came to a complete stop leaving me open to malicious software and persons unknown.     This type of extortion by my own anti virus software leads me to consider switching to another program next time.

I don't really care for the nags, upselling and hassles of Intuit, but the program itself is good. Someday a competing product will raise to the level of acceptance of QuickBooks and perhaps then Intuit will stop being such tools.     If you run a small business this is the software for you. If you have never used it before you should look at taking a basic class on it.  You will get so much more out of the program than without.  There is a learning curve, but once you understand how the program works and basic accounting principals  you will wonder how you ever lived without it.

After several failed installation (which by the way crashed my operating system twice) attempts I finally got the product to install. And then it wanted the product key. I entered the product key that was provided in the package. The program said the product key was incorrect. I verified it and reentered it. It said it was wrong again. I re-verified and reentered the provided product key a 3rd time. The message \\"the product key entered is incorrect\\" presented itself again. I shrugged it off, re-verified the key as correct and reentered it. A message appeared stating that I have activated the program on too many devices and that I was no longer allowed to \\"install\\" the program and that I would be allotted 30 days as a trial period after which I would have to purchase a key. In the end, I never got the product to activate. The trial version was absolutely horrible. The program appears to be primitive and highly limited in its ability to function. Eventually I removed it as it loved to crash my Windows 7 operating system. On a scale from one to ten, I would give this product a negative eight.

I have used every operating system since DOS and this one has no redeeming value.  Even on a powerful new computer with 4 times the RAM it is not faster than XP or 7.  It uses large amounts of resources.  It takes two or three steps to do what, previously, took one.  It is not intuitive and its format is a radical departure from previous GUI versions.  I had a problem with plug-ins to stream music.  This should be an easy fix, but, the ultimate solution (short version) was to re-install the OS.  To those who say that installation is easy, I have to ask why you found it necessary to re-install this new OS in the first place.  I could not see any improvement in the 8 to 8.1 upgrade.  As of this writing, almost 60% of the reviewers here gave this OS a “3” or lower.  And of the positive reviews, a good number had been using Vista (or older?).  That means they really had nothing to compare it to.  And, if you are upgrading from XP, or older, you will almost certainly have to purchase newer productivity software.  So, before you salivate over that great bargain super computer with Windows 8 installed, be sure to factor all of that in.  I've given 8 a fair shake.  After 3 months of concentrated effort, I will downgrade to Windows 7.  It’s a known entity that works well.  My advice to anyone still grappling with it, but who has the option to return a computer while it is still under a satisfaction guarantee, do it now.  It will not get better and you risk losing that option.  And to one that feels that it really can’t be that bad, you really are feeling lucky.  You should not make the leap to Windows 8 unless you have actually had the opportunity to, seriously, test drive it first.<br /><br />There are some excellent positive reviews here, and I am keen to the problems that occur in new software.  But, before you follow their lead, hoping for that one-size-fits-all solution to computing that will take you into the next century, you had best read between the lines of even the most glowing reviews.  Are you a gamer?  Do you run multiple screens at once?  Do you even want to know the difference between RAID and SATA?  Do you want a direct link to the Windows store to purchase all of the new software that may have come with your older computer (but won’t run on 8)?  Do you want to buy a Peterbuilt (with trailer) to run your errands around town?  Are you a techie that enjoys solving “little” nuisance problems on you computer.  Do you enjoy learning new, complex, operating systems so that you can edit a photo or email your family?  Are you willing to put up with a few (if you’re lucky) inconveniences so that you can stay on the leading edge of technology?<br /><br />Windows 8 may very well be the platform that will take us into the next century.  But the numbers don’t lie.  A large number of consumers have found this OS to be hostile and unusable (a higher percentage than I have seen with any previous release).  On my travails I have heard from tech reps that parrot the concerns and have refused to upgrade, themselves, because of the myriad of problems they hear about daily.<br /><br />If you knew that you had a 1-in-4 chance of being thrust into a computing hell with this product, would you still buy it?  Keep reading the reviews (from many sources).  The numbers here are clear.	2013-12-05

I do not use other components of iLife 11 so I can't comment on them.  I take very amateur photos and videos of grandkids and have been looking for easy way to make slide shows and videos of grandkids just for family use.  iLife 11 is easiest way I have found and much easier than anything I tried on PC.  Slide shows with music are very easy to make and don't take a lot of time.  Videos with iMovie are also easy.  The grandkids especially like the movie trailers in iMovie 11.  While I'm sure this might not meet the needs of professionals or advanced amateurs, iLife 11 is great for the casual video and photo person wanting to have family slide shows and movies.	2011-01-08

I have been disappointed with them all but have always given Roxio a second chance with each new release.    I recorded a TV musical in MPEG2 format.    I used Roxio's MyDVD to make the DVD's. So far these are the problems you can expect to see when using this program:    All the video is un-synced to the audio by half a second. It did not matter whether I used MPEG2 video or WMV video files.    What you see on the screen is not what you get. Even though I meticulously manually made every chapter marker, the program decided to place them all one second ahead where I chose, creating unintended effects and losing the impact intended.    The video quality varies and looks acceptable in some sections and looks unacceptable in others.    Yesterday my first DVD attempt, for this project, produced a DVD that did not start at the beginning the the movie, even though I tested the playback of the DVD on the DVD Menu tester. It was supposed to start at the beginning as designed. Instead it started five minutes into the DVD, which was not even a chapter marker location. In fact, with that DVD I did yesterday I had not set up any chapter markers.    Conclusion: Roxio MyDVD is a program to be avoided. It is unreliable and therefore unusable. If one program is unreliable in the suite, how can anyone trust the rest of the software? I have uninstalled the suite for good.	2008-07-09

The program is great! It worked like a charm for me on my desktop and laptop. I plan on using this when working on all computers in the future.<br /><br />There are two reasons for the 4 star rating:<br />1. The overall look of the application window looks a bit unfinished and cluttered. This doesn't take away from how it functions, but it could be a lot prettier for sure! The information for manually updating the video drivers should be in it's own tab, or link to a pop-up or something. Also the extra info and links seem out of place. All of this sits in between the tabs at the top and the list of drivers it finds that need installed or updated. If all this is corrected then it would look a lot neater and deserve 5 stars in my opinion.<br />2. When it showed up it was a plain DVD-R disk. The label was handwritten with a (Sharpie?) pen. It really is a shame that such a nice product is hindered by an unprofessional appearance.<br /><br />Like I said, it functions great. It's just not polished. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody with just a little knowledge of computers. I will get my money's worth out of it no doubt.	2014-03-18

Turbo Tax refuses to take accountability and we are not the only ones with the problem. Look online - we wish we had. This will take us years and cost $$$$$ to fix. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!<br /><br />For anyone thinking or saying that TT has not been hacked, I can tell you we did not and have never even e-filed with it and the person who stole our identity and filed through turbo tax did it exactly one day after we finished printing off our daughter's return to file by mail. They set up a fraudulent email through yandx.com and requested their refund to be sent to a bank in Pennsylvania. We are spending days and days filing various police, FTC, and IRS identity theft reports along with being forced to put a freeze on our credit. This is a nightmare that we will deal with for the rest of our lives. We have always been very cautious with our data(one of the reasons we never wanted to risk e-filing. I just don't want anyone else to have to go through what is happening to us. Don't take my word for it, you can even look on Turbo Tax's facebook as well as online in general for multiple reports of others who have been hacked. Beware. I hope a class action lawsuit will follow.	2015-02-25

Nice smooth install, even on raid system <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1. Driver support lacking <br />2. Software support lacking <br />3. Price <br /> <br />Push: <br />1. Eye candy <br /> <br />The only thing I found better about Vista over XP was the installation process. The GUI effects are a nice evolution for the Windows platform, but certainly nothing groundbreaking. <br /> <br />As for the cons, it is probably more a knock against the 3rd party vendors then it is against Vista.  One would think that these vendors would have invested more time and resources into their Vista drivers, but sadly many drivers are still very buggy (nvidia), in beta, or not being supported at all for some products (i.e. several HP printers).  Fortunately, you are able to install XP drivers if they are properly signed (in most cases).   <br /> <br />Also note that certain programs will not run under Vista even though they ran under XP (e.g. Quickbooks 2006).  If you have \\"legacy\\" software that you need in your daily computer life, make sure it is supported under Vista or at least find out if there is an upgrade available.  If you plan accordingly hopefully you won't have any unpleasant surprises.   <br /> <br />Don't forget that when you upgrade your XP license is no longer valid.  If you plan to dual boot, get the retail version or use the upgrade workaround. <br /> <br />Recommendation: Stay with XP until more of the driver and software issues are resolved or buy a new system that is completely Vista compatible.  No matter which way you go, this upgrade will not come cheap (in money or time)	2007-02-11

I have slowly transitioned away from Microsoft Office and have cautiously-embraced Google Docs.  My office suite needs are pretty simplistic: basic word processing and rudimentary spreadsheet usage.  Through the years, I've found that with all the \\"new\\" changes that Microsoft has incorporated into their latest-and-greatest version of Office, I probably can still get buy with one of the original editions.  With this in mind, if you really need Microsoft Office, then Office for the Mac 2008 is certainly a decent place to start.

It is very different and has been hard for me to learn. A great thing you can do is multi-camera editing. You can take video of up to four views of the same thing. You sink the sound, and leave the top video track blank. The program shows you a box with your 4 (or fewer) clips (your different views), and another box that shows which of the 4 you have made active. You PLAY, and as it plays, you click on which ever track you want to show. It fills in the top track what you choose. You can set one track as master sound. I made 3 clips with VideoStudio, Multi-cammed with this program, rendered the result, then used the rendered video in a VideoStudio project.   The 304 page manual is excellent.	2009-08-23

I'm a defector who come from Turbo Tax Deluxe (user for 14 years). This is my first year with H&R Block Tax Deluxe. I installed the software on a desktop with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit version. The process went without a hitch. The software imports the 2013 Turbo Tax file without any problem on the first try. I start the Fed 1040 form and import my W-2 online, again, not a hitch. From there, I continue for about half hour, and I finished the 1040 with refund similar to last year that I got with Turbo Tax.  I got the job done as expected ... for half the price of Turbo Tax. So from now on, H&R Block will have me as a new customer.  No more last minute extortion for upgrading ...    I also have a wish list:  - The text on the interface is little too small to read (font size 8?)  - Print the completed return + the worksheet to keep for record (in PDF) could combine into one file included Fed and State forms.  Thank you.	2015-02-15

I bought this version to use on my three computers. The first one I tried is an older Dell laptop that I've installed three prior versions of this software on before. The first step is always to remove the prior version including the directory from the the C: drive which I did this time also. The machine reads the DVD/CD and appears to be working, unpacking files, etc. Then a text box appears that says: Installation Without Javascript with a text link below that that leads you to the Kaspersky support website if you click it. Below that in the box is an install button which I clicked. It looks like all is going well and then it asks to reboot the machine to finish the install. The machine reboots but does nothing else. I mean, this is just a basic low level laptop with XP-SP3 on it that I use to surf the web and look at my gmail. No massive, complicated pieces of software reside on this machine, it's really pretty simple and so should this install be (I love Yoda-speak)..<br /><br />I ran through it all again up to the point of the text box and clicked over to the Kaspersky support site where I entered the \\"Installation Without Javascript\\" message. Unbelievably, (OK, maybe you would believe it!) this message is not found anywhere in their \\"knowledge base\\", not even something close, just nothing is found. This is so very helpful!<br /><br />I tried the install a few more times with the same result but I don't have time to deal with faulty software in my busy life. And I certainly don't have time to deal with Kaspersky's support staff which will probably involve many hours and emails trying to figure this out. I'm just going to return this defective software back to Amazon and move on to another one of the top rated anti-virus software packages. Sorry Kaspersky, it was nice while it lasted!<br /><br />Update: 01/24/2013 - I decided to give Kasperskysupport one chance. I went to their website and left a message for customer support. They promptly sent me two emails, one with a ticket number and one with some suggestions as to what to do. The one that caught my eye was a utility to delete a prior version which I had already done using Control Panel plus deleting the directory structure. Apparently that is not enough (perhaps there were some left over registry entries) because once I downloaded and ran their removal tool the new version immediately installed. I'm upping my review to three stars and not four because I think that I shouldn't have had to go through this just to get the old version removed. Why don't they just include the removal tool as part of the distribution of the new version? Would have saved me a lot of time!	2013-01-18

Among the many, many problems we had with 8.1 one was that the old Hoyle Casino game disc wouldn't run on it.  Since my husband really enjoyed playing those games, especially Texas Hold `Em, he was very unhappy.<br /><br />So for Christmas I went looking for a Hoyle game disc that would run on Windows 8.1.  Although it wasn't shown as working with 8.1, I immediately saw a customer question and answer indicating that it did.  So I jumped on it.  Unfortunately, while it does indeed run on 8.1, I should have checked it out further.<br /><br />Although it has dozens of games, it only has two &#34;casino&#34; games- Black Jack and straight draw poker.  Not my husband's favorite, Texas Hold `em.  He has played it a lot since Christmas and can't say he's very happy with it<br /><br />For poker fans, his biggest issues are 1) the system limits the amount you can bet but doesn't place the same limitation on the other &#34;players&#34; and 2) is even farther away from true random than most computer games.  If you have a stellar hand, 95% of the time another player will have something even better.<br /><br />He has played the other games (mostly because the poker is boring) and noticed that for many games you need to have the audio on (no visual cues for draws, bids, etc)  So if you are buying for your kids to play &#34;Go Fish&#34; you may want to invest in some headphones for them :-)  If you are just looking for a lot of variety in games for kids, this is probably a good choice.<br /><br />So, I was going to do the research to find a better game option, but then I heard the news.  Microsoft announced that Windows 7 thru 8.1 can upgrade to Windows 10 for free the first year.  Yea!!  Evidently they figured out that a system designed for a mobile device isn't the best choice for a desktop so there are two versions for 10.  So I'll wait until after we upgrade to look for a better casino game option.<br /><br />Update 8-21-15  We upgraded the PC to Windows 10 and the game continues to function with no problem and no need to reinstall.Windows 10 and the game continues to function with no problem and no need to reinstall.	2015-01-25

About 2 and a half years ago, despite my having invested almost a grand and a half on a top of the line PC system with ME as my O.S., I got daily system freezes, crashes, and error messages with Millenium Edition.  Clearly, ME was a defective product, and Gates should issue a consumer recall and reimburse those who purchased Win ME.  Perhaps there should be a class action lawsuit as well.  Of course, civil e-mails and customer service calls to Microsoft were NEVER returned.  Not once.  Is this the 'respect' that Gates has for his customers?!  Out of sheer desperation, and a need to be productive and to preserve my sanity and health, I was told by an 'IT guru' that a clean install of Windows XP Home Edition would solve my problems, so I fell for it.  Two hundred bucks later, I have tons of 2 to 4 year old Windows software and games that simply don't work on XP, or cause system errors and crashes!  I am now back at square one, and faced with the prospect of having to throw out over $3,000 in Windows 98/ME software that doesn't work well with XP!!!

I have had a terrible experience with Scribe. I've been trying to transcribe a one-hour audio-recorded interview.

I tried to call and ask how I could save the transcription in progress, and was told it can't be. When you save, it saves as a Text Edit file which does not allow you to keep transcribing from the audio; it just becomes text so you have what you have transcribed up to the point of saving and the remainder is the rest of the audio transcription Scribe pulled up (which is so far off, I can't follow it at all--AFTER the \\"Training\\") with no way to continue transcribing.

I put up with this irritation thinking it was harmless, but then I noticed that the program's security features were now unavailable and my computer was completely unprotected, because Bitdefender had shut off the Windows firewall and antivirus protection! Upon contacting tech support, they wanted me to download a test file to test if Bitdefender would detect it, but when I went to the website for this test file, there was a disclaimer - the website said although the file was not a virus, it mimicked one and consequently, it would be very difficult to remove from the computer and they would not provide any assistance to remove it. 3 weeks is too much time to waste on this.

I own those also but I know what to expect when I buy a \\"cheap\\" game. I know the bonuses are the same on each slot but maybe I am just old school. I grew up on the Atari 2600 which the graphics were way worse than these but the games were fun and I still play them. Good graphics and sound do not always translate to a good game (Wave Rally PS2). I have other games with good graphics but suck in gameplay. Most of these kinda games are sold in the bargain bins at Target etc. I just picked up \\"Club Vegas Slot's\\" volume 1 & 2. They probably will look and play just like the ones in this game.     These kind of games are probably good for people that can't afford to buy the better ones all the time or just need something to pass the time which it does. I would rather pay for a bunch of cheap games instead of more money for one good game.	2011-09-20

I had to pick a rating to write this review, so I picked a 4.<br />I mainly wanted to respond to Mr. Hutchinson who warned people that Broderbund's version 5.0 is NOT an evolution from version 4.0 but an entirely new program that is incompatible.<br />Mr. Hutchinson recommends Chief Architect version 5.0 as the true successor to version 4.0.<br />I'll concede his point, since I don't know otherwise.  However, what he doesn't tell you is that the Broderbund version 5.0 is $30, whereas the Chief Architect version 5.0 is $500!!!!!<br />My 12-year-old, 8th-grade daughter, as a result of a school assignment, showed an interest, and a flare, for home design.  I thought it might be nice to give her a program such as this for Christmas and see if it captures her imagination.<br />$30 I can afford.  $500 would be ridiculous for such a gift.  My requirements: easy and fun to use, and rewards the user with a 3-D rendering of their idea.  I don't care what it's compatible with.  I don't care that it only prints on 8 x 11 paper.  And, I don't care if the software could actually be used for a real home project.  My teeny-bopper will not be designing homes any time soon.<br />Mr. Hutchinson didn't claim there was anything egregiously wrong with this program - only that it falls short of the Chier Architect software.  OK, fine.  Send me $470 and I'll go for the other one.	2003-11-20

Unfortunately, although Camtasia is available on both PC and Mac platforms, they are NOT compatible. While it is true you can open the *video recording* on either platform, you cannot open the *project* file, which is where you assemble the movie. Video capture is only one small part of creating a video; there is also editing, audio, animation, captioning, callouts, you name it. So I can import a video captured on the Mac into the PC and vice versa, but I cannot open the project file which it will go into. This reduces my Mac to a video capture machine, and why should I shell out $300 for a program that duplicates (badly) the video capture program already built into the Mac operating system???<br /><br />This is 2015, not 1998. If you're going to sell &#34;cross-platform&#34; software, make sure it is truly compatible. This is massive fail on a development level.	2015-05-01

It gives you the ability to start almost anywhere making it ideal for beginners through experts. Being a beginner when I bought this program I started with the alphabet reference and a grammar tutorial. These were both very good features and after some practice they helped to lay a good foundation for further learning. From here there are endless things to do. This program does an excellent job of teaching vocabulary and useful phrases. Perhaps one of the best things this program does is working on your pronunciation. In several different activities I had to speak Italian into a microphone and it was compared to a native speaker's pronunciation which helps you to drastically improve your own pronunciation. I am more than satisfied with this program and I highly recomend it.	2003-07-02

I downloaded the trial version to give it a test and was immediately put off by the programs inabilities. For example, after adding any type of special effects or even transitions to very small snippets of the HD video, the program would crash. Even if I saved the file after every command, it would crash during the video file creation to a DVD format. Ideally, one has to first convert the HD .mov video to an .avi file, import that file into the program, and then work with it (which it did well enough in Videostudio 11). [Unfortunately, my Canon software won't allow me to convert those files on my computer. I would have to buy a video conversion program (like DDvideoHD for around $30) that would maintain the great HD quality of the original files from the conversion. Who wants to waste time with file conversion with several gigabytes of video files and then spend a lot of time editing them? I just want to open my video files directly into the editing software and work without any problems.]    So, I am very disappointed in the program because of the inability to work with this type of HD video file. Also, I might add, after working with X3 with some previously converted .avi files, the program worked well, but frankly it seemed like a modest upgrade from its earlier version. (Note: I also tried Sony's Vega HD version 10, which seemed to work well with the Canon's HD files, but unfortunately it created poor quality DVD video files from those files.)    As an aside I have to ask: There must be thousands of people who own cameras with this type of HD video compression (which is basically a Quicktime movie). What editing software do all these people use that works well on a PC?	2010-07-31

There are not many reviews on this product so I thought I'd toss in my 2 cents worth.  Out of 20,000 games you'd think there has to be a few good games in the mix, right?  Nope. I was hoping to be surprised by finding at least a couple of gems but unless you love Bejeweled type games they are all stinkers.  In reading the previous Amazon reviews I wondered why no one listed any of the games but now I know its because they are all forgetable.  Sadly, many of the games I had a slight interest in would not even load.  So the bottom line is unless you want to own an expensive 2 gb thumbdrive I recommend that you pass on 20,000 Games.  Instead, buy Torchlight as a digital download. It's less than $20 and will run perfectly on your Acer Aspire One 722.	2011-11-23

I had the opportunity to review Fix It Utilities 11 Professional. And I am ever glad I did! It arrived at the  perfect time! We had a computer bug and Fix It found the problem and deleted it for me!  Set up was a breeze. You are able to use it on 3 computers, thankfully, that's how many computers are  resident in our home!  The user interface is quite simple to read, navigate and use. I like that. I'm not a techie person and having  something easy to use was a huge boon to this product.  I especially liked the one page at-a-glance PC health screen. It shows all in one place the overall system,  security, and maintenance health of your computer.  Every time you download a new program, the system makes a recovery point. I like that. That way, if I  mistakenly download a bad program, I can go back to the recovery point before that error and restore my  computer. I also like that the program takes care of disk defrag and all those little housekeeping needs.  I haven't needed it, but the program also has a shredder that is supposed to be as top notch as the US Dept  Of Defense's shredder!  Also included is an anti-spyware and anti-virus program. I already had one of each of those installed, but  have disabled those and am using Fix It's version. I have had no problems since installing this program.    As a non-techie computer user, I recommend Fix It Utilities 11 Professional. It is easy to install, set up and  use.    *This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User Community  (NDUC).

US	40403485	R2JVKIXNHLTLVZ	B002SZC6VG	962480467	Fields Of Glory	Software	5	2	2	N	N	Ultra Realistic Strategy War game	One thing I remember about this game when I first played it, I had commented to friends and family \\"It is so realistic, I can almost smell the gunpowder\\".  It truly is a remarkable game.  I wish they had continued the series or done more with it.  Maybe they could have introduced some kind of campaign feature.  Well a more open ended one than what they did have.  You play through a series of battles fought during Napoleon's last campaign and some hypothetical battles if Waterloo or other battles had not turned out the way they did.  One fascinating feature the game does is how it represents armies on the screen.  You may not see one on screen soldier for everyone actually on the field, but you will see soldiers drop as the fighting progresses from each cluster of soldiers which are grouped in to units of actual composition of the actual armies that fought.  One commander over sees 2 battalions of a brigade or about 1800 men, in some battle fields.  You can command individual battalions or the entire brigade or a army group or whatever scale you need.  This depends on which officer you click on.  The higher the rank the more troops he can command at once.  This is a nice way to represent realistic and historical army numbers.  It is a great way to implement strategy by structuring the game and command system this way plus it is a realistic system comparable to historical reality.  I would love to see more games operate in a similar fashion.  If one of your historical officers gets killed or wounded in action and needs to be replaced, one is randomly generated to step in.  This is another nice realistic touch that even now, I do not see in strategy games.  So even by current standards, this game is still pretty progressive and it has unique factors that few if any games have yet.  These are nice elements however to have in any good strategy war game.	2012-12-12

US	13607760	RR38G2T9TL9UL	B000BJ461O	994277507	Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss	Software	4	5	5	N	N	We were there first.	What was the first 3D, first-person shooter? A lot of people today would say Doom. A few who are a bit more in the know would tell you it was Wolfenstein 3D. Almost nobody would say anything about Ultima Underworld.<br /><br />This game hit the shelves shortly before Wolfenstein 3D. (An early demo, in fact, was an inspiration for that game.) When you compare the two, you will be amazed. Although primitive by today's standards, the graphics and mapping are amazing. This game is superior in every way to its better known contemporary. You face a greater variety of foes, have more available weapons (and modes of attack) and have an opportunity to develop your skills as you progress. The game environment itself is vastly different, the walls are textured and curve (as opposed to flat and blocky). You can swim, run and jump. You can also interact with various items in a way not available in Wolfenstein.<br /><br />Another major difference between the two is that this game has a storyline. Although it is only marginally related to the main series, you play the Avatar of Virtue, hero of the original Ultima series. You are on a quest to rescue a damsel in distress, save the world from an indestructible demon and prove your innocence in the process.<br /><br />You explore a seven level dungeon and interact with a variety of characters---most of them friendly. In your quest you must collect several powerful magical artifacts, some made for you and some incidentally useful. The backstory is fascinating in itself, as you learn about how the Abyss was populated and the groups fractured into warring factions.<br /><br />There are also a couple of amusing Easter eggs planted throughout the game, the most interesting of which caught me totally off guard.<br /><br />Although the game engine and graphics are, as I said, primitive by today's standards, this game has worn well. Since it has a lot more to offer than point-and-shoot, let's-spray-some-blood, violence, aging graphics cannotundo the charm and interest of this game.<br /><br />Try it out for yourself, you'll be pleasantly surprised.	2006-07-23

I was going to sit out a version, based on what people had said around here.  I'd even bought a copy (at Costco) and returned it, after reading the complaints.  Then I found one for sale at a computer show at a steep discount, and decided to try it out after all -- AFTER thoroughly backing-up my data.<br />I'm happy to say that yes, things have gotten slicker, and bigger, but they've also gotten better.  The last release (2000 Deluxe) had some &quot;features&quot; that drove me nuts, and these seem to have been addressed (I like to think because of my ... to Intuit's feedback e-mails).  These fixes are enough to justify the upgrade, for me.  <br />Here's a list of what's immediately apparent: The Alt key works properly again.  (Alt-F goes to the file menu.)  There's an easily-customizable toolbar, to which I added things I had to search endlessly for in the past (e.g., how to pay my mortgagees -- scheduled transactions).  There's a &quot;recategorize&quot; feature (which I found in the toolbar customizer) that let me fix up some old data in obsolete categories.  (Probably it's been there all along, but I just didn't know about it.  I've had that happen before with Quicken!)  The help has gotten better but still could use some help.  (Example: I'm in a credit card transaction.  What does the Ref field hold?  Hitting F1 doesn't tell me -- I have to do a search to find out.)<br />Things they still haven't fixed: Making a loan payment still brings up invisible accounts under the &quot;Choose Loan&quot; list.  (Obviously nobody at Intuit ever had their mortgage sold or refinanced.  Guess that's what you get when your programmers pay for their houses in cash.)  There are still ads for services, masquerading as Quicken features -- and you can't remove them.  (Example: &quot;Backup my valuable investment records&quot;.)  I can't seem to find a &quot;What's new in Quicken 2001&quot; (there are lists for every previous version, though).<br />I still approach download of transactions with the greatest of caution, having been burned by this software in the past.  (It downloaded things I did't understand, and created duplicate transactions.  Basically it made a mess.  You have to decide: either enter data manually and reconcile to ensure correctness, or abandon reconciliation and correctness and use Quicken as a computer-based bank statement.)  The situation is perhaps worst with online brokerage accounts.  I haven't tried it yet with this release, to see if there's been an improvement.  When I have a spare couple of evenings, perhaps I'll try it.  Like maybe when I'm retired.  (That's also when I'll explore all those new features they've added.  There must be a cast of hundreds working on this stuff.  Something for everyone?)<br />In short, it seems like a decent upgrade.  Some annoying problems were fixed.  The database remains rock-solid.  Undoubtedly many worthy features were added.  Are they essential?  (How have you gotten by, up 'til now?)  Would I have bought it for $..., in retrospect?  Sure.  Quicken and I spend a lot of time together.<br />My general advice remains: Stay away from automatic downloads and account updates (automatic ANYTHING) and you'll be okay, at least until the machine really does learn to think for you.  Do you REALLY expect an answer when you click on &quot;How should I invest my money?&quot;  (I expect it to say, &quot;Upgrade Quicken!&quot;)	2001-02-18

I did go through a period where I had no use for it so it sat in the sidelines.<br />Recently my work has changed and I now need a scheduling program again.<br />So I come to find out that my version won’t run on windows 8, or 7 for that matter (it’s been a while).<br />So where do I go but to turbo project.  Look around and order the software.<br />I received an email after my order.<br />Your license information is (blank)<br />You may download using the following URL (blank)<br />So I wait and get and hear nothing. I started sending emails and got no response. Finally I did get a response (after threating to go to pay pal and complain) and ultimately a temporary Key # until they figure it out.<br />Guess what? Haven’t heard a word from them since. Imagine that !<br />This isn’t really a money thing, my employer will supply what I ask for. from Here I’ll go back to project, which I’ve used also. I like to use the little guy and see our money go somewhere besides the big box people. When I don’t feel any respect, I’ll gladly go to someone that is working for the good. Not the take the money and run guy.<br />Now the insult on injury. The day after I ordered the standard for 80 some $ I start getting emails from support to get the pro version for half that. WHAT? I did ask and never heard a word from anyone.<br />It’s a good program, I’ve used it for years, but Support is nonexistent!  If you have a problem your out of luck.<br />I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of, buyer beware. The program works well but if you ever need any help, good luck.	2014-03-04

Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware 2009 is not a complete security suite for your computer. It is an antivirus with an antispyware component, but is lacking three important things.<br /><br />1. An email blocker to stop spam.<br />2. A blocker to stop malicious downloads for websites.<br />3. Alerts for unsafe websites.<br /><br />While not a resource hog, Trend Micro does slow down basic Internet surfing somewhat. I found it's updates took a bit longer to receive and install than AVG, Kapersky and Vipre too.<br /><br />After swearing off Norton and McAfee for their resource hogging properties as much as anything, and then off BitDefender for it's glitchy performance, I've tried many other antivirus programs. This one is mediocre and not feature-rich.<br /><br />My advice: shop around and compare features. Price differences are minimal, and some offer many more features for about the same price.	2009-08-20

If the price were about half of what it is then it would be a pretty good buy.  There are no explanations in English about how the grammar works so that remained cloudy. Even after going through all 3 levels I wasn't able to carry on a conversation.  For a better program at a lower price, I strongly recommend Fluenz. The grammar is explained by the teacher very well and I'm starting to be able to carry on a conversation.     UPDATE 11/2/09    I've been going through RS again and since I have a better understanding of the grammar (thanks to Fluenz), the program has become more useful. However, RS is not a good choice if you're learning a new language from scratch. It's a good supplement (although a very expensive one), but not good for primary learning.	2009-02-23

I bought this product with the hopes that I could organize a fiction project that has grown to over 350,000 words (pre edited obviously).  Importing the files from Microsoft Word was tedious, I had to save each as rtf format and then import. Considering I had 50-odd chapters when I started, that was a pain, but I did it.<br /><br />The help files aren't very helpful, but email support was good. I've experienced some strange issues they've never seen before, never did get to the bottom of them, but they helped me make them \\"livable\\".<br /><br />The tutorial didn't make a lot of sense to me, I'd prefer a different format because while you're reading it, you can't be doing what it suggests (setting up a file, etc) at the same time. That would be something to consider doing in the future...making the tutorial/help files in a pop up box that won't disappear as you play with/practice on the actual files.<br /><br />With a lot of playing around & trying different things, a LOT of looking through help files and emailing support, I've figured the program out for the most part.<br /><br />The best part about the software is the outline pane on the left, it has become invaluable to scan the entirety of the storyline (w/ plot headers) instantly.  Also the ability to track characters is excellent (IF you take the time to keep the files up to date!).<br /><br />Obviously, the more you put into this software, the more you'll get out of it. This software does not \\"prompt\\" you to do anything, but the tools are all there if you so choose to type the information in. When your story covers 35 years of a family's history, with several interwoven back-stories and sub-plots, you're wise to track it all from the beginning.<br /><br />My only regret is not having this software 5 years ago when I started this project; it would have made it so much easier!  For the money, I definitely recommend this software.	2007-09-27

The main disc of the Criterion CD-ROM set includes the movie and a Spinal Taplet, which allows you to run DiBergi's film in a small window on your screen while you work on other things. It also includes running commentary from David, Nigel, Derek, DiBergi and his crew. The director provides a cautionary note early: He doesn't sound happy that his documentary is being dissected, fearing that its subtleties will fall limp under the hot lights. But what headbanger can resist a CD-ROM that cranks the volume to 11, which is one more than any other CD on the market? The disc also provides the option of viewing favorite scenes by choosing memorable dialogue or gigs. The bonus CD includes 10 scenes from the cutting room floor, a 16mm short DiBergi used to pitch his concept to Hollywood, assorted documents with notes scribbled in the margins, and an odd trailer about a dangerous but merry Scandinavian giant cheese festival. The Danes rolling the 100-pound loafs look suspiciously like members of Tap, leaving this reviewer with the feeling that it was DiBergi's idea of a joke.<br /><br />Inside the CD kit: There's also a nifty find function, which Voyager describes this way: &#34;The Find command in the Spinal Tap CD allows you to search for any of the dialogue from the movie. In addition, you can search for words and phrases that are not actually spoken--such as 'pap' which is written down, and 'we love you' which is mouthed--or for objects, such as shower cap.&#34;<br /><br />The box included a bonus guitar pick! GREAT for TAP!	2014-01-16

Installation was very slow on my WIN 7 PC. Interface is a bit disappointing. This is 2011 and software should be much more dynamic considering the target audience. During launch of the software, the application checks for updates. There was an update available. After installation of the update, the application freezes. I uninstalled and tried again several times but the update causes it to freeze each time. On the 4th attempt, I ignored the update and the application works fine (albeit it is still lame). I do not recommend this software at this time. Maybe when they spend a bit more time developing more dynamic content, and a better user experience, it will be worth it.

The pianos are seamless and Like-God.  I don't have experience with other piano VSTs, but I read many forums to arrive between Steinway's East and West, Pianoteq 3, and Ivory II.  Ivory II I think would have ended up being my first choice regardless, but for further purchasing, Amazon doesn't seem to have Pianoteq 3.  So...  make sure to have a proper controller.  Mine is a Roland RD-700GX, the finest action (and keys) I have ever found in a keyboard or grand.  That combined with Ivory II makes for the last concert grand one should ever need until they get the real thing, which following Ivory II is really just a novelty :-)  Cheers, glad I got this one, here's to better music.	2012-02-21

Be aware, this software really needs 2 gigs of memory to function, while most netbook comes with 1G memory only. Be expecting to upgrade your netbook memory if you choose this route also.<br /><br />It works fine. The training took me about an hour all total, with an initial session that I did and saved some of the words it had missed. One thing I like about the software is that it does let you save words that it has trouble with, so in the future it gets them right. It 'learns.'<br /><br />If I have other application running at the same time and there is less than 2G memory for Dragon Naturally Speaking Home 11, it wouldn't let me use MS Office. I have to use it with notepad and then copy-and-paste the contents over to Office. It's a bit of work but not all that big of a deal. I don't have any lag or problems with it this way.<br /><br />One thing may bother some people is the privacy, as this software wants to go through your emails and documents - this is to let the software know more about your vocabulary and the way that you write normally. There's also a request by the software to let you store these things online! They say it is to improve their software for future editions. Fortunately, it DOES give you the option to opt out this function.	2013-01-07

Simply the best. I spoke 0 spanish prior to this, and knew nothing and now in level 4 I can hold up a conversation. Sonia takes you and is your tutor for the whole program. She explains everything and never leaves you confused with something, but if you are confused, Fluenz has a whole online community that you can ask questions and an employee writes back to you. Or other users write back to you. The online community is fantastic. It is other people trying to learn just like you are.<br /><br />Fluenz takes you on a journey and your own personal tutor is there for it. Sonia is fantastic. The workouts in fluenz make you remember the words without countless hours of just studying vocab. I'm halfway done with level 4 and at most 1 workout takes me  30-45 mins at level 4.<br /><br />I'm halfway done with level 4, and I watch Spanish TV everyday and I have many Spanish friends who i talk with. I can have a conversation in Spanish at this point. Fluenz sets up the ground work, but you have to get out there and do more to get that much better. Everyday since lesson 1 at level 1 I was watching TV in Spanish. Fluenz will get to a high level, but with any language program, you need to put work in to get results. This is a serious program for serious people who want to learn spanish. And you will get serious results. And fluenz is the best program out there to help you learn.<br /><br />BUY THIS PROGRAM IS YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LEARNING SPANISH. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. WORTH EVERY CENT	2014-01-25

It was horrible, BUT Apple has done a 180 on this product and is doing leaps and bounds to fix the issues.  Their tech support is good and they've helped me work thru some of my issues.  This product is something that should never have been released when it was, but they extended the trial period to 90 days to make up for it and I'll probably pay for it once the trial is up.  It's a great service for us iPhone users.  The Mobile Me email interface is weak, but I don't use it anyway since my other IMAP and POP3 accounts work just fine.  I love how it syncs my calendar and contacts with Outlook and my iPhone.  Apple still needs to make some improvements on the me.com site, but for now I'd say it's worth the discounted price from Amazon...not the full retail price from Apple.	2008-10-24

Sadly, my hopes were dashed shortly after opening the sealed software box. Inside, there was a flyer that indicated that I needed to go to a Microsoft web site, enter in the enclosed PIN and doing so would get me an activation code that would allow me to install the product. After spending hours of time entering the code by replacing 0 with O and such, I gave up and called MS Support.     A rep indicated that my PIN was for a retailer to activate and that I needed to contact the retailer for resolution... before I did that MS called back to say that Amazon retailers were having this issue and that I needed to contact Amazon support for resolution. The result, they credited my account and I'm sending it back.    With all the productivity I've lost just resolving the issue, Office just doesn't feel all that productive.

I had used a different-brand database on earlier visits; that one almost always recognized the names of places I wanted to go and how to get there, essential in a country where the roads and streets seldom display names or house numbers. The Orwellian-named EZfind  usually didn't recognize destinations, and even when it did, got lost trying to get there.  It DID, for instance, recognize the names of my Hotel near San Jose and my  car rental place near the airport, but got so hopelessly lost I finally resorted to paying a cab driver to escort me there, so I could still make my flight home; the taxi escort cost more than the EZfind. On one occasion, I actually had a full address to input: city, house number and street; it went unrecognized. Finally, it frequently beeps loudly to warn of  speed bumps and one-lane bridges, simultaneously displaying explanatory messages in SPANISH.	2015-03-14

Try downloading and installing it once unsuccessfully ,did not think too much into it though because i had more than 8 months until expiration date on what i had. Close to expiration date it's only recently that i tried again to install it and to my surprise it's not working. After several calls to technical support which at first resend it to me via email ,then i was transfer to customer support (sales department) because they couldn't see (find) my transaction then back to technical support again then back customer support who finally admit to have messed up and did &#34;fix the problem&#34; and emailed me again a non working downloadable Kaspersky internet security 2013  until i ask to speak to the supervisor who was very understanding and said that she could only help me get a refund and things of that nature but she couldn't help me that i had to call back to technical support.So back to square 1. A few days later, expiration date getting closer and having an infected computer i've had it, i uninstalled kaspersky and found me a free antivirus and actually the best in the world finally trojans ,viruses and adwares free. All i wanted and still want is getting my money back .I called customer support but only got a voicemail which they called back a few hours later and provided me which another number in order to get my money back. Called explained all i've been through ,frustrated angry ,she just told me that i bought it almost a year ago and that the refund wasn't applicable i went on to explain to her that i knew their policy but my case was no ordinary one. Tired of not getting anywhere with her i ask to speak to her supervisor and after being put on hold for 5 minutes .He picked the phone up and listened to my &#34;story&#34; then just told me the same generic answer sorry but we can't refund you  it's been blah blah. A customer of more than 3 years who has been through hell (morethan 2 hours wait or/and hold time) with you admitting to have &#34;messed up&#34; ,the unability of your technical and customer support to solve the problem and that's all you can come up with??? I've recommended people to your company for God's sake. So i'm out of my software and of my money. Terrible customer service ,terrible product. It's been a fun 3 years but i'm done with Kaspersky.	2014-08-08

I've played the game it's-self for a little over a year. It is fun, with good graphics and some fun quests. If you join a guild you can choose to participate in nightly siege wars against other guilds of a similar level. In truth though, it does get boring completing what seems like the same quests over and over; by killing basically the same savage dogs, scorpions or beetles throughout the games levels. Although the game has made some improvements, its still can be quite glitchy and laggy. The support staff is known for being atrocious. To summarize; it's worth a try if you like WoW clones, but don't pay a third party for a free game.	2013-03-08

I'm a database coordinator for a large healthcare company and am thoroughly familiar with computers.  After I became familiar with this program a little, I loved it.  But as my files became larger, and I moved quicker, the program would lock up and then corrupt the files, causing me to start over.  It isn't my computer because the PC is brand new and has plenty of memory.  I did finish the book - 101 pages - but it was frustrating.  When I took it to a professional printer to have it printed, the files wouldn't print right and several of the fonts were lost, so it didn't turn out like I'd hoped.  Even now, when I go to print from my printer...it loses fonts and takes FOREVER.  There weren't enough graphics either, and you can forget about importing graphics from other programs.  You need a lot of patience - and time.  It's still quicker than the old-fashioned way, but I expect better performance.  Make sure and do the research - I'm hoping I'll find something better before I get started on the next book.	2002-07-15

Up until this weekend, I was using the 2008 version and was being forced to upgrade to the 2011 because online support for 2008 was ending in April. For me the online features are very valuable, so I made the switch. The benefits of the new version? Brighter colors in the graphics and that's about all I can see so far. In the past Quicken upgrades have had some real visible improvements. This time around? Not so much. So my advice for anyone who doesn't need the upgrade to stay online is to wait.    Sooner or later Google or someone else will eat Quicken's lunch if they can't do better than this. They are just collecting rental income on old intellectual property.	2011-03-06

Also, the online help is only average - difficult to find particular problem areas.  Second, and of much more concern, is the conflict with other programs.

This product (\\"System Builder\\") is NOT for upgrading; if you are upgrading from a previous version of Windows, then get the upgrade package.    This is the \\"OEM\\" version of Windows 8.1. Perform a web search for: Windows 8.1 OEM license. According to Microsoft, if you are building a computer for personal use, then the \\"Full packaged retail product is needed.\\" With the OEM version, you cannot get technical support from Microsoft; also, you can activate it on one and only one computer (the license is linked to the hardware). If you want technical support and/or the potential to transfer the license to a new computer, then look at the \\"full\\" version ([[ASIN:B00EDSI7QO Microsoft Windows 8.1 - Full Version]]).    This is NOT the \\"Professional\\" version of Windows 8.1. Make sure you are selecting the version you need/want. To learn more, just perform a web search for: Differences between Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Professional. Windows 8.1 Professional also comes in an \\"OEM\\" version and a \\"full\\" version: [[ASIN:B00F3ZN0CC Windows 8.1 Pro System Builder OEM DVD 64-Bit]] and [[ASIN:B00EDSI8HW Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro - Full Version]].    I just installed Windows 8.1 System Builder on a newly-constructed computer. It loaded very quickly (approximately 20 minutes). Loading Window Updates took roughly another 30 minutes. I gave Windows 8.1 a five-star rating because it is much faster and much more stable than the Windows 7 that I use every day on another computer. My Windows 7 machine crashes at least five times per week; in contrast, my Window 8.1 Professional machine and my Windows 8.1 machine have never crashed, frozen, or reset.    I did have one mishap as I loaded software on my new Windows 8.1 machine. As I went to load an old version of Roxio, Windows 8.1 warned me that it was not compatible; but I loaded it anyway. Upon rebooting after that, Windows 8.1 was somehow compromised, and its Auto Repair function initiated a complete wipe and reload of Windows 8.1. Lesson learned: I will not attempt to load old software and hardware on my new Windows 8.1 machine.    Windows 8.1 has many powerful features that were completely new to me. The easiest way to learn about these new features is to read a book (just search Amazon books for \\"Windows 8.1\\"). I liked [[ASIN:0735683638 Windows 8.1 Inside Out]], but it is more in-depth than most people probably want.    THE \\"DESKTOP\\" IS STILL THERE:    A lot of folks I know HATE the new \\"Start\\" screen (\\"metro style\\") user interface. I spent several weeks learning how to use it; but in the end, I abandoned the Start\\" screen in favor of the (old familiar) \\"Desktop\\" app. So, to all you folks who hate the Start screen: Just use the Desktop instead. You can switch to the Desktop simply by pressing the key combination [WINDOWS key]+D. Or, as I did, you can setup Windows 8.1 to boot to the Desktop instead of the Start screen. Simply (1) go to Desktop; (2) move the cursor to a blank area of the Toolbar at the bottom of the screen; (3) right click and select \\"Properties\\"; (4) select the \\"Navigation\\" tab; (5) place a tick mark in the box next to \\"When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of start.\\"    You can setup up your Windows 8.1 Desktop to be just like your old Windows 7 Desktop, except there won't be a Start button. (Quite frankly, those Microsoft folks made a huge mistake taking away the Start button.) On the Desktop, you can also setup the Tool Bar (Quick Start icons) and System Tray just like you did in previous versions of Windows. In short, you can make your Windows 8.1 look just like Windows 7, but the underlying operating system will be much quicker and a lot more stable.    Speaking of the Start button; Windows 8.1 adds a modified Start button of sorts (a Windows-Flag) at the lower left-hand edge of the Desktop toolbar. If you left-click on it, it opens the \\"Start\\" screen (the same effect as pressing the Windows key on your keyboard); if you right-click on it, it opens the \\"Power User\\" menu (the same effect as pressing Windows Key plus X simultaneously). Once on the \\"Start\\" screen, if you click on the little arrow at the bottom left, you will get a listing of your programs/apps (essentially providing the functions of the old Start Button, and more).    I found it helpful to add the following icons to my Windows 8.1 Desktop: Computer (formerly \\"My Computer\\"), Control Panel, and Network. To do this, right click on any clear area of the desktop and select the Personalize option. In the left pane of the Personalize window, click Change desktop icons. Tick the boxes for the icons you want displayed on the desktop (Computer, Control Panel, Recycle Bin, User's Files, Network). Click the Apply button.    I have read that \\"Windows 8.1 Update 1\\" will boot computers without touchscreens to the desktop by default and will use desktop apps by default. Of course, Microsoft (OBVIOUSLY) should have had this feature in the original Windows 8.    That's enough about how to set up the Desktop. Once you get Windows 8.1 working on the Desktop app, take some time to learn how to use the new \\"metro-style\\" user interface. On my dual monitor system, I have the Desktop on my center monitor and the \\"Start\\" screen (TileWorld) on the side monitor. You should probably get a book to help you customize the Start screen by learning how to add (pin), delete (unpin), resize, move, and group tiles. I think most non-business users will prefer the new Start screen interface.    WINDOWS 8.1 IS EASY - BUT ONLY AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF TRAINING:    Let me just say: Microsoft made a huge mistake by not including a very simple and obvious tick-box to provide users with the option to \\"Use Classic Windows.\\" Now, it only takes about 10 minutes to get Windows 8.1 to look and function just like Windows 7; but that's 9.5 minutes longer than it should take! Also, Microsoft should have provided a simple and obvious tick-box to allow users (especially business users) to completely disable the new Metro (Modern) interface.    It takes some effort for the new user to learn how to setup Windows 8.1; but after you get it setup, your Window 8.1 machine will be very easy to use (you won't even think about it). You should probably get a friend, grandchild, or book to help you on your first day. Just about everybody should get some Windows 8.1 training, even if that training is nothing more than watching some youtube videos. Obviously, Microsoft should have produced some videos (maybe eight 5-minute videos) to orient the new user! The user interface is so different most folks will get angry with it if no one has explained it to them first. You see, very little is obvious or intuitive; all of the menus are initially hidden, and there is no clue as to how to display them. But don't get angry! Just spend a short time (less than an hour) learning some basic Windows 8.1 tricks and secrets. When I built my new gaming computer fifteen months ago, I read the book [[ASIN:1118204131 Windows 8 Secrets]] in its entirety before loading the operating system. It's a good thing I did, otherwise I would have been lost (and, yes, probably angry). Luckily for new users, lots of nice people have posted some great youtube videos that can potentially teach you most of what you need to know. You could also go down to your local computer store and play with Windows 8.1.    You can save yourself a lot of (first-day) anger and frustration by immediately configuring Windows 8.1 to use the Desktop user-interface instead of the new Metro-style user-interface (per the instructions above). Do this immediately after your computer boots to Windows 8.1 for the first time. If you do, you'll find yourself in a (relatively stress-free) familiar environment . . . something that looks andbehaves just like Windows 7, but without the \\"Start\\" button. Other than that, printout and use the Windows-Key shortcuts discussed below (especially Winkey+C and Winkey+I).    WINDOWS-KEY SHORTCUTS MAKE LIFE EASY:    Memorize and use the \\"Windows Key\\" (Winkey) keyboard shortcuts! (The Winkey is the key on the bottom row with a depiction the Microsoft flag; my Winkey is just to the right of the CTRL key.) For example, if you hold down the Winkey and press C, the \\"Charms\\" bar will be displayed. The \\"Charms\\" bar is perhaps the most important interface in Windows 8.1. If you learn the Winkey keyboard shortcuts first thing, you will be able to get most things done in Windows 8.1 right away!    Helpful Winkey keyboard shortcuts:    Winkey: toggles between Start Menu and last app  Winkey + D: opens Desktop  Winkey + C: opens \\"Charms\\" bar  Winkey + E: opens file explorer  Winkey + F or Winkey + W: searches for files  Winkey + I: opens the Settings charm (to shut down your computer, for example)  Winkey + Z: opens \\"app bar\\" (the menu user interface that is normally hidden when interacting with a Windows 8 app)  Winkey + X: opens the \\"power user\\" menu (which includes programs and features, power options, event viewer, system, device manager, network connections, disk management, computer management, command prompt, task manager, control panel, file explorer, search, run, shutdown or signoff, and desktop)  Winkey + R: opens run-program window (like when you used to go to Start, Run)    LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT WINDOWS ACTIVATION:    Windows 8.1 activated over the internet just fine. I had read that Windows 8.1 activation was tied to the specific motherboard; but, apparently, Windows 8.1 loses its activation if you change the memory or hard drive. When I changed out the memory modules (for larger capacity), Windows gave me a message that I would need to re-activate within three days. When I decided that I wanted a larger hard drive in this new machine, I cloned the smaller driveto the larger drive; in the process, Windows activation was lost on the larger drive. Lesson learned: Your life will be easier if you finalize your hardware installation BEFORE you activate Windows 8.1.    LOCAL ACCOUNT VERSUS MICROSOFT ACCOUNT    You can setup Windows 8.1 user accounts to be either a \\"local account\\" or a Microsoft account. Just perform a little web research for: Difference between local account and Microsoft account. There are pros and cons associated with each option.    Quite annoyingly, it is NOT obvious how to choose \\"local account\\" during the installation of Windows 8.1. Understandably, some folks are angry because they feel that Microsoft is FORCING their new Windows 8.1 machine to be linked a Microsoft account. Actually, it is simple (but not at all obvious) to setup Windows 8.1 with a \\"local account\\" (so the operating system is not linked to Microsoft).    During installation of Windows 8.1, when you get to the \\"Sign in to your Microsoft account\\" screen, don't enter the log-in information (account and password), instead: (1) at the bottom of the screen click \\"Create a new account\\"; (2) on the resulting \\"Create a Microsoft Account\\" screen, just skip over all of the empty fields and select \\"Sign in without a Microsoft Account\\"; (3) on the resulting \\"Your Account\\" screen, setup your \\"local account\\" user name and password.    To switch from a Microsoft account to a \\"local account\\": (1) Get to the \\"Start\\" screen (toggle Windows key); (2) type \\"Users\\"; (3) select \\"Add, delete, or manage other user accounts\\"; (4) on the resulting \\"Accounts\\" screen, select \\"Your Account\\"; (5) select the \\"Disconnect\\" option and then setup your \\"local account\\" user name and password. To switch from a \\"local account\\" to a Microsoft account, perform Steps 1 through 4, then at Step 5 select \\"Connect to a Microsoft account.\\"    You can also setup Windows 8.1 to use a four-digit PIN.	2014-02-01

It seems nearly as powerful as the full Photoshop, but easier to do common tasks.  Seriously.  Why did I spend years messing with the full version and paying all that money for the full Photoshop, when most of what I need to do is fewer clicks in Elements?    I didn't really need the Organizer feature, but it has started to grow on me.    Ok, now for the \\"lowlight\\" -- Premiere Elements.  Featurewise, yes, surprising how much you can do vs. the full version.  Most Prosumers like me would be happy looking at the feature list.  Furthermore, the usability is much easier than the full Premiere.  But that's where it seems to end, at least for me.  The performance was flakey sometimes... I'd click on a filter and sometimes the app would just chug for a while and stop being responsive.  At least it didn't completely crash like Sony Vegas -- it would at least eventually return.  If you don't need to use the preview, then I find it's possible to workaround the problems by simply doing your expensive filters and stuff last, and skipping the preview, going straight to render, although obviously render can take a long time -- another thing I didn't like.  I haven't figured out a way to save my projects in such a way that the original codecs and content are preserved.  You have to use the \\"Share\\" button for dummies.      But, in all fairness, it seems to get the job done, and I'm still learning.  But in reality, for the money, Windows Live Movie Maker is still the winner for most of my simple jobs.  To be honest, I might have skipped straight to Premiere Pro, but this bundle is a great deal.    I only subtract the 1 star because of Premiere Elements being a little sluggish compared to Vegas.  Otherwise, I think this is the best bundle a beginner-to-intermediate prosumer could buy.    But, you don't have to take my word for it, because you can download the trial versions of both and play with them for 30 days.	2011-07-19

The Norton let me down when it let several email virus's &/or Trojans get into my mail and start sending themselves out to everybody in my address book. This has made everybody in my address book very mad at me!<br /><br />There was one thing that the Norton has over the AVG and that's the identity storage. This made it really easy for storing my user name and passwords for all the important sites that I used. Like my bank, the bill paying sites, and the suppliers that I use for my wood working and pen turning supplies. The bad part of that was that I quit backing up my most used passwords on a separate text file. Now that my Norton has expired, even though I did save a backup copy of my identity files, I can no longer access my passwords! The back up file is in a .NPM format that I cant find a reader for or any way to convert it to something I can open. It would be nice if the AVG had a compatible part of its program or similar function.<br /><br />As for the installation of the AVG, it went very smooth with no problems at all. I was able to install the AVG before removing the Norton so that there wasn't a gap in my protection. The update and first scan went very smooth and the whole thing took less than an hour. As for how good the AVG protection is I will have to come back in a few months and update this to let you know. But for now I'm very pleased with it.	2011-05-31

She doesn't type very well, she hunts and pecks alot.  As she is a Spanish Teacher, and manages the National Honor Society she has LOTS of reports, reference letters, and the associated parent letters, newsletters, emails,etc to do on a daily basis.  This program HAS MADE HER LIFE 1000000% easier and her workflow so much faster.  She is not a computer person and she was using it to \\"type\\" within minutes of my having entered the license key and setting up her microphone that comes with the package.  It takes a little while to learn how to talk to it but OMG it works wonderfully.  She loves it, and loves me for getting it for her after seeing her struggle for so long.  What's amazing is she can also use it to enter grades in to realtime -- you teachers out there know what that is.  Anyway, I purchased the \\"teacher/student\\" edition.  It DOES NOT come with a serial number.  Once you install the software you are directed to the website where you must enter some info as to where you work, or if you are a student, and it has to be verified.  I installed the software for her on 12/26/2011 and the software was verified the same day though it does say it could take about 24 hours.  Once you are verified as a teacher or staff, they send you the license key.  Kind of a pain in the arse, but let me tell you IT'S WORTH IT.	2012-01-29

I like the program and it works really great for what it is and once I can create my own objects, I will use them with Poser. There are a lot of objects to buy and get for free to play around with.

Norton will pop up once a few minutes after start-up, and (so far) it won't update when you tell it not to. McAfee will update anytime you're on the internet, even when you tell it not to. This is a pain for those of us with no access to broadband (yes, there are such places) as it slows everything else I'm doing online to a crawl. Aside from the once-daily reminder, though, they leave me alone when I'm not online. Not Computer Associates. CA pops up every few minutes wanting to connect to the internet -- even when I've turned off the automatic updates. This, by the way, was after the first installation on a laptop, when it had spent the better part of two hours downloading updates. It already was up to date, and its status box even said so. But did it let me work? Nope -- every few minutes it popped up on the screen wanting to fire up the modem and tie up my second phone line. News flash for Computer Associates: I have better uses for that phone line than making your program happy. The cherry on the sundae is that you have to click the cancel button TWICE to make the connect to the internet box go away! End result: I've uninstalled CA, trashed the CD, and written the whole thing up to learning a lesson about software from Computer Associates.	2007-09-06

I have to disagree with the other reviewer. There are some tribal graphics, i'd say about 40%. Alot of great images. There are some images that would not be so great for vinyl cutters. The lines are too thin unless your cutting out a massive size decal. They would be great for someone coloring in and printing out with a contour cut. It's a decent set.

It would appear that one reviewer in particular did not actually play the game to understand how it works, so I'll tell you. It is alot more than having your villagers research, farm, & breed. There are puzzles to be solved. For instance, I'll give away one of the easiest puzzles, you have to clear the well so the villagers can drink water & water their crops. To learn how to better farm, to gain better knowledge in construction, gain spirituality, etc... you have to use tech points to be able to purchase more knowledge in each area. The more knowledge you have the more your villagers will eventually be able to do & the more puzzles they can solve. You get tech points by various things your villagers do, be it researching at the table, learning about the plants on the island,  or learning how to heal eachother, etc... The more tech points earned the more knowledge you can buy. Yes, this game is real time, but you can double that time. You also don't have to worry about going away for long periods of time only to have your villagers die. There is an option you can check to pause the game indefinitely until you return. If you wish to cheat & play the game in a day you could do so by changing the time on your computer, open your game, & changing it back again after you re-open the game. You can advance as much as you like by doing this, but be aware that skipping ahead more than an hour or 2 can really wreack havoc on your villagers. This is a sims type of game, though, so the majority of people playing this I would think would be the type who enjoy more laid back games that take a while to unfold. It's definitely not for the impatient. Even using the cheat to skip your clock ahead can still take quite a few hours for you to actually finish the game. It's not a bang bang shoot em up kind of game, it's just there for you to relax & enjoy, and think just a little. :) There's alot more to the game than the negative reviews on here would have you believe.to the game than the negative reviews on here would have you believe.	2007-08-05

I found this software on line after attempting to find nutritional information on the FDA website. (baring teeth!)  That was worse than a painful root canal!  This software allows you to enter your recipe - it then automatically calculates the nutritional value of each ingredient.  It even locates, within its database, any ingredient for which the match is inexact.  You can also add ingredients.  The finished recipe nutritional information is provided which looks just like the labels on manufacturers packages.  Wonderful!  The best $35 you'll ever spend.	2011-03-15

Note that the recommendations to update to the latest driver is no longer relevant.  The product I received had the latest driver already.  The audio would transfer, but the video screen was always blank.  I wasted a dvd to make sure it really wasn't just a problem with the software display.  I even updated the driver for my video card to make sure that wasn't the culprit.  It obviously works for some hardware.  I can't really recommend this product, but for those willing to take the chance I recommend immediately returning it if it doesn't install out of the box.  There are clearly many systems this is incompatible with and attempting to get it to work is futile.	2014-06-29

I can't tell you how much I loved playing it years ago. I, personally, still think it holds its own today. Maybe not in the hyper-realism graphics category, but the concept and plot is surprisingly enjoyable. There are lots of clever twists on common objects, and a whole slew of snarky characters/dialogue.<br /><br />However, this game can be exceptionally difficult at times, and I've never known anyone able to beat the game without referencing a walk-through at least once. At the very least, you'll need a map of the barrow when you get out of the void. Or you'll wander aimlessly for hours.	2012-08-10

I bought this game almost two years ago for my son (who is now five).  Today was the tenth time in the past few months, I have come down to see what he is doing with the game and found him doing something new and he's been playing it pretty regularily since we got it.  He was taking the pictures they give you and using a special window that enlarges them so you can change the colors.  Everything from lines to pictures can be three different sizes, different colors, different mediums (chalk, paint, marker etc.).  One set of pictures isn't pictures but sounds.  I could go on and on.  My son could probably go on longer than that.    The only reason I see for giving this software anything less than five stars is the disc isn't working.  When I bought it all the reviews said five stars.  That was the only way I bought it.  And the best thing for me is that is downloads onto your computer and you don't have to keep putting in the disc to play it like all the rest of my kids games.  Which of course leads to scratches and ruining the game.  But really if you can find a good copy, I can't recommend it enough.

I spend a lot of time reading and understanding.  The software makes it very easy and user friendly.  I feel that I make better decisions during the year from a tax perspective and keep better records throughout the year because I do my own taxes.  I love this stuff! Definitely worth the money.  My previous guy who did my taxes cost me over $2,400 and did no better job with them.  I also used this software in combination with HR Block Home for my father in law who also has a business.  I helped my father in law, used the software and took everything to the tax guy as my father in law insisted.  The tax guy cost him $275 to give him the same exact result I did with the software.	2014-01-23

What are the limitations of a non-commercial version?  It really does little more than the word processor and spreadsheet that come free with Windows.  This version is not compatible with Office 2003 unless you download an update from the Windows site.  I can not do this download at work, so I can not work on documents at home and then continue them at work. There are virtually no significant improvements to this suite compared to the 2003 Version.

For me personally it is the best experience I have had through all the iterations of Microsoft's OS. Windows 8 is a massive change. Some would say ambitious or drastic in a lot of ways. At first glance Windows 8 is an absolute nightmare to any fans of the previous version of Windows. The metro interface is a massive turd. It only belongs on a touch screen interface, never on a proper PC.<br /><br />The reasons I got windows 8 is because I built a new computer for the sole purpose of gaming. Windows 8 offers the exclusivity of Direct X 11.1 support, so I wanted to be covered in the event that any games come out in the future that either require or benefit from 11.1. There is also a marginal increase for performance on a lot of current titles. The boost is barely noticeable, typically 1-2 frames per second in most cases. Hardly anything worth noting.<br /><br />I am only just now beginning to enjoy Windows 8 and that is because I purchased a program called Start Is Back. You can find it easily enough via Google search. I picked up 5 licenses for the stellar price of just $5! So I was able to get my Windows 8 looking and feeling just like 7, but maintaining all of the under the hood performance tweaks that I bought it for. If I couldn't have a program like Start Is Back I would have given this a 1 star. Windows 8 solely by itself is complete and utter rubbish. I would rather huff a wet fart from a hobo's backside than ever have to look at the metro interface. Thankfully, I have it bypassed, never to be seen again.	2013-04-13

I finally broke down and bought this software.  I've been wanting a good home design software and have yet to find one.  I've recently tried HGTV's Home Design and Remodeling Software and was disappointed so I decided to try this one.  The 3D walk-though is a joke.  The screen is black and I have to hold down my left mouse button to get it to show.  The quality of the rendering is a joke.  It cartoonish at best.  It is also not easy.  When I put the bathroom features in such as the tub, sink and toilet, they were floating on the ceiling.  To get a piece of funiture to reposition at an angle, you have to know measurements and enter it into a field instead of simply grabbing a corner handle and moving it (i.e. 360 degrees, 120 degrees, etc.)  I hated this software.

You can check some of my previous postings, even as crazy and memory hungry as Adobe Premier Elements has been I always thought it was the best user interface...just a great simple to understand interface to get things done. Having said that I was not confident in recommending it to countless friends who asked for my recommendation on editing software for their home video. Most of them simply did not have the computing power and memory to overcome Premier Elements memory hog headaches.    In addition to Adobe I have used Magix Movie Edit Pro, Corel VideoStudio Pro and Pinnacle Studio. Magix is a second to this new Sony release; however, NOT a close second...just second.     I am comfortable now in recommending Sony's Vegas Movie Studio HD. Yes you need some specific computer power and memory but from what I have thrown at it so far (1080P MTS and AVCHD files from my Canon, Samsung and Pentax Camcorders...it has performed flawlessly.    I have also enjoyed a stress-free, crash-free rendering and burning to DVD all types and lengths of video footage.    It appears that Sony got this right and we will all benefit from it.     If Adobe was ever to get off it's tail and actually add some real user value to a next release...as well as do something about it's memory appetite and unstableness I might go back, but for now I'm making Sony Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0 my goto app for video.	2010-08-26

We've been using Quickbooks in our manufacturing business since 1993 and I was a big fan of Quickbooks until I was forced to buy this version in order to keep using Intuit Assisted Payroll.  We should have switched payroll systems and stuck to our 2008 version of Pro Multi-user.    The changes to the networking for multi-user access do not work on an otherwise perfectly functioning network.  It's not our network.  This has crippled our business.  The old Quickbooks ran fine and our custom manufacturing software uses intensive file-sharing on the same network without any problems.     There are no productivity enhancements in this new version that we will use.    Basically we have a single user program.  I'm looking for a new accounting package after 18 years.

I agree with the other reviews that this product has problems, especially there product support.  And there response time was not very quick.  I don't recommend this product.	2010-05-17

Using it (and I have over 100 hours into my current project with it) can only be described as having a fight with your CAD system.  I find the user interface very confusing, inconsistent, frustrating, and seems to have a mind of its own (&#34;No Dave, you can;t do that&#34; - HAL from 2001:A Space Odyssey&#34;). Object snap seems to have a preference to make lines that you want horizontal or parallel at a slight angle (&#34;You really don't want those 2 walls perpendicular&#34;).  Walls that you have carefully revised to place exactly where you want them (Finally!) change by working on what one would assume to be an unrelated part of the design.  The worst part is that you don't know that anything has changed until you discover it later.  There are lots of Chief Architect help videos for lots of topics online but most of them are for versions of the software like Xpert and Premium.  Which brings me to my next issue.  How can they call this version &#34;Professional&#34; when it limits you to a maximum paper size of ARCH C, that's right 18&#34;x24&#34;.  The worst part is that they let you create a design on ARCH D paper but inform you when you go to plot it that you can't plot to that size without upgrading to the Xpert version for an additional $2000 bucks!  Yeah, right!  (You can however rent the Xpert version for about $199 per month and that will allow you to print to ARCH D if you want to go that route).  I'm also amazed that something that proclaims to be an architectural CAD system forces you to implement some pretty unlikely &#34;cludges&#34;.  For instance, when I couldn't figure out how to build a chimney, I finally found online where somebody recommended using a cabinet soffit that went from the floor through the ceiling and poked out above the roof.  Of course!  How silly of me not thinking that in reality all chimneys are made out of cabinet soffits!  Then I found that if you want to make a porch with an overhanging roof that is supported by posts and a beam -- yep, cabinet soffits are your answer.  Same goes for non-horizontal beams -- cabinet soffitsare your man!  Then if you really are a glutton for punishment, try making winder stairs.  I finally found a video for the Xpert system that showed how it was done which kind of sort-a worked on Pro but I couldn't get the various stair segments and platforms to &#34;join&#34; consistently into one coherent stairway system like they did in the video.  Sometimes segments would join together and sometimes they didn't, but I never could all of them to join into one coherent stairway system so I ended up having two short stair flights that I jammed together so that they looked like one.  And that is after you fight to get the corners of your platforms to snap the the corner of the adjacent platform (did I mention snaps have a mind of their own -- &#34;you really don't want the 2 platforms to be joined at the corners -- what you want is a 73/100&#34; gap between them and then once you get them to snap together and you work around the rest of the platforms only to find that the 73/100&#34; gap has somehow magically reasserted itself.  Have I used the work frustrating yet?  I called various architects around town to see if any of them used Chief architect and would be able to help me with several of the issues that I was having and pretty much got the same response -- &#34;we just use it to do quick approximate 3-D renderings.  We use AutoCAD to do any serious precision work.&#34;  That is where I'm at now.  A rendering doesn't have to be perfect.  For my serious stuff I'm using my 2001 AutoCAD Lite where moving a wall doesn't take two hours to figure out (actually, I was able to move a downstairs wall on first try -- it displayed some little arrow buttons that I could click to specify which end of the wall I wanted to lengthen.  However, no such luck with the upstairs wall directly above it.When I select the wall, it won't display the end buttons and always insists on moving the opposite end.  Opening the wall object and selecting Start, End or Center locking of the wall has no effect (that has worked for me occasionally as I tried to manipulate walls around).  I'm not sure why selecting a wall sometimes will show the &#34;which end do you want to move&#34; buttons and sometimes it doesn't.  Selecting a wall across the room and editing the distance between them always moves the wall across the room.  I have yet to be able to move the wall I want to move accurately and just have to settle for turning off the object snaps and moving it manually to get it &#34;close enough&#34; (&#34;You really don't want to move it 2 inches, you want to move it 1 13/64&#34; &#34; -- have I mentioned that this program is possessed by HAL?) .  Sometimes when I right-click select a wall it gives the option to align the wall with the wall above or below.  In this case, that option isn't available to align the upstairs wall with the wall below which is positioned where I want it, however, if I select the wall below, it does have the option to align it with the wall above which means I can move the lower wall out of position to be aligned with the above wall that the system seems to refuse to allow me to move where I want it.  Have I said &#34;frustrating&#34; yet?  This program definitely has a very steep learning curve that one shouldn't have to put up with in this day and age.  Oddly enough, most people seem to have difficulty with creating roofs.  I've managed to manually model my fairly complex hip roof system without too much difficulty.  The only problem that I have encountered is with one rather odd roof cricket.  The other cricket I was able to make with no problems.<br />I'm writing this review as one who has worked as a CAD system programmer since the mid 1980's (CADAM/Catia, Computer Vision, GenericCAD, and as 3rd party developer for AutoCAD).  I'm also saying this as one who has worked as a residential contractor with an Associates degree in Architectural Drafting.  The only reasons I haven't returned this product is because I bought it too soon and didn't start using it until the 90 day grace period had already expired, also, the 3-D renderings work well enough for what I need even if your model isn't perfect.<br />If this is your first shot at using a CAD system I'd steer clear of this program.  If you are a rusty professional that needs to put together a quick project, look elsewhere.  I would also like to point out that this is the first negative review I have written for over 100 online purchases on Amazon and Ebay.  I'm not a sour grapes individual.	2015-02-13

The product arrived without Mac drivers (despite being advertised as Mac-compatible) and the drivers available for download are very buggy. Simply put the software, and thus the scanner, does not work as advertised in recognizing Asian characters. To compound the annoyance, my efforts to contact support have met with the staff evading my queries and responding, at best, by just sending me links to the same bad software. I give the product two stars, rather than just one, because I have been able to scan Japanese cards into one version of the software and then use the OCR of another version to capture the data. In other words, with extra effort, I found a way to make it work. Finally, I should note that you may have a better experience if you use Windows.	2008-04-12

Like 2010, this version is easy to use, idiot-proof, and worth every penny.  It updates the antivirus definitions automatically, its default settings are not annoying in the least, and it scans automatically when your system isn't being used. Its firewall protection is second to none, and at least once a night it detects and blocks an unwanted internet intrusion on my computer.<br /><br />It is really fire and forget with Norton Internet Security 2011.  You can have as much, or as little, control as you want.  I went through the default settings after installation and the only change I made was to not delete tracking cookies.  Everything else was just fine.<br /><br />The basic interface is the same as last year's version, and it adds a few things I like.  For instance, it tells me if a particular program (like Firefox or Explorer) is hogging up an unusual amount of memory.  It adds a \\"reputation\\" scan to determine the reliability and trustworthiness of your existing programs.<br /><br />For those who have complained that installing Norton 2011 takes away your remaining subscription time for your current Norton product, I fully agree that is unacceptable.  I can only assume that the new installation wipes the old installation and therefore resets the subscription to 365 days, regardless of whether you had days remaining on your existing Norton subscription.  If you have time remaining on your current subscription, DO NOT INSTALL VIA THE 2011 DISK.  Instead, select \\"check for new version.\\"  Follow the steps to download and install IS 2011.  When you reach the required reboot, do so, and after the reboot you will have the option to now enter your new product ID number (found on your new 2011 disk), which will activate your 2011 version of Norton while retaining any remaining days you have existing left on your current subscription.  You paid for 365 days, so make sure you get every minute you paid for!	2010-12-02

If you have a dual core 64 bit processor in your mac.  You will notice significant improvement in leopard.  It take 0 time to load... Thats compaired to Tiger, not windows...  Enhanced Graphics are cool.  The cover flow and quick look feature are cool.  However 90% of the time you will know the name of the file your after so these features are not nessessary, and just take space up from the number of files you can view at one time.    However if your looking for a file that you cant remember the name of, but you know what it looks like, then these features will come to good use.  Like I said this is only maybe 10% of the time.    With Mac's market saturation increasing its starting to become a target to people who make virus's and malware.  So time machine will help play an important role in protecting your data.  Not just from replacing corrupt files but from harddrive failure, (assuming your backing up to an external hard disk) and from your own negligence.    *note time machine protects data by backing it up, not by removing virus's or malware    I preorded Leopard.  I recieved it and installed it at 10 am on the 26th of October.  I do not have an external Hard drive.  I have backed up some things to my current hard drive, but quit because I didn't see the point.  Other than it booting quicker, it hasn't been worth it for me.  I think boot camp was buggier after upgrading.  I haven't used cover view other than show others how cool it is that my mac works like my iphone.  I haven't used quick look except to see how it worked.  If your just an average computer guy, who surfs the internet and checks e-mail...  It might not be worth upgrading just yet.  Hold off, untill you have a reason to upgrade.	2007-11-06

The ability to create custom sports cards was something I was really looking forward to.  I read previous reviews about the software.  Mostly great, so I said \\"why not?\\"     Pros:  This program was easy to install.  Adding photos and stats are a sinch and it does indeed take about 5 minutes to create a card.    The quality of the pictures were neat!  Now comes the fun part.    Cons:  1.  It took me nearly an hour (8 test pages and 5 glossy paper pages) to callibrate the card to line up evenly when you print out your final product! You have to manually adjust the settings in order to \\"line up\\" your card.  And even after that, when you hit print, the image is still off-line! I wish it had auto callibration.    2.  The paper is soo expensive.  I ordered the 100 sheets for $80 as a classroom expense which this was.  Not to mention the amount of ink spent on callibrating the darn image to print straight!    3.  The glitches.  After creating several cards, I wanted to make some changes on cards I created say... 10 minutes earlier.  8 out of 10 times the software did not recognize its own file!  \\"This is not a valid cst file\\" message appears.  Very wrong and frustrating.  And when it did recognize it, when I clicked \\"edit stats\\" on a saved card, all my stats were gone!    I kid you not, my stats were converted to this:  \\"sjkdsakldhflak adjkfhalkdfhlak adkjfhalkdf adkjfhalkdf adskjfalskdf\\"    4.  The restraints are that there is a custom link for football, baseball, basketball, soccer, and hockey.  Great if you want to fill the stats out for the back of the card.  I do not however, and there was no way to remove those categories from there.  If you do not enter data, those categories still appear regardless.  Now I coach youth volleyball and have 15 student cards to print out.  It is no fun when you cant retrieve the files after working on them, saving them, and no longer being able to access it or retype everything.    If anyone knows of any other type of custom trading card software that is realiable, easy to use, and recognizes its own files, please let me know!	2007-06-03

At times it will inexplicably lose parameters off of parameter dials; it will show the parameter dial for a particular object with parameters for another object.  Just now it was showing me the parameter dials for &quot;main camera&quot; with options such as &quot;twist&quot; which were obviously for another object, I think a neck).  As I was trying to move a prop, it suddenly gave me an error message saying an object with that name already exists so the name has been changed; a review of the prop list shows it has added a copy of the prop and given it the name of another (third) prop with &quot;-1&quot; appended, which I didn't tell it to do, and which didn't have anything to do with what I was doing at the time (except that it copied the prop I was trying to move).  It's really incomprehensible.  This has happened several times and once a file is messed up this way it's ruined, although earlier saved copies are still ok.<br />As I say, I'm enjoying the program a lot when it works, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore.  I kind of resent Curious Labs for releasing it in this condition--given the enormous amount of time one must often invest developing a 3D scene.  I've downloaded the two patches on their website and they didn't help anything.<br />I'm running it in Windows XP with 640 Megabytes of RAM and a 1300 megaherts AMD Athlon processor.	2003-07-12

All image editing software has strengths and weaknesses, and this is no different in that regard.

YES! it's the best operating system I've seen out of Microsoft to date. <BR>This is the first time that an upgrade has sped up my computer's operation....and that's just for starters. <BR>For one thing, this OS is STABLE. One of my programs seemed to have hung(it was actually just taking too long) and I hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and eliminated the offending program without touching the rest of the system. <BR>The new TrueType font display makes reading text on a screen a 100 times easier. <BR>The new look is a lot slicker with its glossy taskbar and new-style Start menu. <BR>The new Media Player works a lot more smoothly. <BR>Internet Explorer seems to be loading up pages faster. <BR>The startup and shutdown is quicker. For once, logging into a home system is secure, as the OS supports multiple users, at two different security levels (Admin and limited). <BR>DirectX in conjunction with other tweaks has improved the overall multimedia experience. <BR>The built-in firewall offers some additional(but minimal) security<BR>This is the BEST home OS to ever be released by Microsoft. Now, the CAVEATS:<BR>In order for this OS to be stable, they had to dump any and all legacy code. This means that you should do an INTENSIVE INVENTORY of your system and make sure that  drivers compatible XP are available for all your stuff and newer versions of software or patches for old software, otherwise, DO NOT UPGRADE. This is not just the same stuff with a snazzier looking start button. There is a SIGNIFICANT difference in this code, so if you are running a DOS program that's very dear to you, forget it, it's not gonna work. Even for stuff which is only 1 yr to 6 months old, check with the manufacturer BEFORE YOU PERFORM THIS UPGRADE, NOT AFTER. There is NO DVD DECODER built in, you have to obtain this from either your computer manufacturer or your DVD Player manufacturer. <BR>The Control Panel and other parts to the Windows Explorer interface have changed, to give a more basic and user-friendly look. HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REVERT EVERYTHING TO THE OLD-STYLE IF YOU CAN NO LONGER FIND WHAT YOU USED TO LOOK FOR.<BR>If you are somebody who tampers with your computer every two weeks, then the activation feature will ANNOY YOU GREATLY. However, if you leave your computer alone for the most part, then you will probably only ever need to activate your computer once, and activating your computer does NOT require you to send any private information about you or your computer to Microsoft. That is a fallacy. You can activate your computer by phone too, if you refuse to use the internet. An automated voice dictates a code to you which you enter to activate Windows. Yes activating windows is annoying and it does reek of despotism, but for most users, you shouldn't have to do this often, probably only once. To which I'm sure someone will make the argument: Yea but this is a Microsoft operating system. That means I'll have to reformat my hard drive and re-install at least once a year  --> to which my response is that for once Microsoft has produced a STABLE system and you probably won't need to redo everything (but even if you do you can re-install 3 times without having to call Microsoft to re-activate).<br />VERDICT: <BR>If your computer is brand spankin' new, this OS is for you.<BR>If you have lots of old software programs you are very attached to, or hardware, do NOT upgrade<BR>If you want a system that is stable, fast, and nice to look at, and only have Word documents, MP3s and Photos on your current computer, and like to browse the web, DO UPGRADE.<BR>Just to repeat: DO NOT UPGRADE IF YOUR COMPUTER HAS LOTS OF OLD HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ON IT. AND FOR THOSE WHO DO DECIDE TO UPGRADE, MAKE SURE THAT _ALL_ OF YOUR STUFF IS COMPATIBLE BEFORE YOU UPGRADE.	2001-12-05

I'm a big computer enthusiast.  I love all kinds but am in no way a fan boy or hater of any particular OS.  I have Mac OS computers which I love and one Windows 7 Machine that I assembled.  It's a watercooled dual GPU machine built for gaming primarily but I do general computing on it as well.  I have windows 7 Home Premium on it which I loved.  It is a beautiful, elegant, and efficient OS.<br /><br />I had read about some concerns for windows 8-that it is designed more for touch or that it was pieces of different type of interface all glued together and so on.  I was concerned.  I read a pretty in depth book about windows 8 prior to installing it so I can be ready.  I did a fresh install just to make sure it works as smoothly as possible.<br /><br />My impressions of windows 8:  Frustrating to use and clunky would be a kind way of describing it-at least my own experience with it.  The interface is extremely frustrating to use-this is even after reading an in depth book about it.  It just doesn't feel \\"right\\" using it.  I don't even know where to begin-from the start screen tiles to the desktop being an app-almost like an after tought for a desktop PC.  This to me smells of design by committee type of a product.  They think of all different things they want in there and just glue it on without regard to the final product as a whole and how the user actually uses it.  It is disappointing, frustrating and frankly infuriating that they would take a beautiful OS like Windows 7 and turn it into this.  Shameful.<br /><br />Thank you Microsoft but no thanks-I'll go back to Windows 7.  I hope they can fix this horrendous GUI to salvage it and do better for windows 9.<br /><br />Disclaimer-As in all things, this is my own opinion and subjective experience.  Your experience with this OS might have been better than mine.  I really was looking forward to it since it did have some cool technical improvements under thehood but given the GUI interface, I just can't stand using it.	2012-11-16

Gives you amazing control over converting color images to b&w, using predefined templates, additional templates from their website, and also custom setting you can make, and save. Absolutely fantastic. I am running it on an intel Mac Pro w/ 8 Gig of Ram. It is very fast when launched from w/in photoshop. I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 because it is incredibly slow working w/ large 12 and 14 bit raw files when launched from Apple Aperture (but fine from w/in photoshop). A number of people on the web have complained about this and Nik has yet to acknowledge this as a problem. I even offered to help them trouble shoot it to find out where the memory/performance issue was coming from and they didn't respond to my offer. One solution seems to be to launch the plug-in in 8 bit photoshop mode instead of 16 bit but that is just a work around, not a real solution as other Nik software works fine w/ photoshop in 16 bit mode. Overall a great product, I highly recommend you download the 14 day demo and give it a try, and then buy it if you like it as much as I did. The Aperture slow performance was almost a deal-breaker for me but I purchased it anyway knowing that Nik would eventually have to fix that one problem area.<br /><br />UPDATE: 5 stars. Nik has released version 1.001 which addresses the Aperture slowness problem. Nice and fast now. Highly recommended.	2008-08-11

My main reason for buying a Mac was for my hobbies in photography and videography.  I was using Roxio's Easy Media Creator video software for creating DVDs for my home videos and I wanted to move on to the next step.  At first - I considered trying Adobe Premier Elements - but that was too complicated.  I did a lot of research online and the one thing that struck me was that a lot of reviews were recommending Mac software. <br /> <br />Although I had iLife '05 - I still decided to buy iLife '06.  The compelling reason was really due to the new features with iPhoto, including: <br /> <br />1. Ability to support more pictures in the library - up to 250,000 pictures <br />2. Ability to support linking of files to the library - instead of copying the files and taking up more space. <br /> <br />I had recently purchases a high-end digital SLR and for those of you with a digital camera know - you'll definitely have way more pictures owning a digital camera than a film camera.  Whenever I take pictures - I can easily take 500 pictures at a time, and if I do that twice or three times a month, that's close to 2,000 pictures.  Within a year - I would have maxed out the capabilities of iPhoto '05. <br /> <br />The other cool thing is that iPhoto '06 doesn't have to copy the files from my source to it's own iLife directory.  So now - I maintain my own directory structure and when I 'import' to iLife '06 - it creates a reference - thereby saving me hard-drive space that can be used to store even more pictures!  The additional benefit is that whenever I make changes to a picture file - iPhoto actually makes a copy and operates off of that copy - thereby perserving the integrity of the original.  So if I want to 'revert to original' it's just a mouse click away.	2006-06-20

Of what use to the film industry is a program that limits how producers, directors, other writers and production members can use a script, such as that produced with Hollywood Screenwriter?  It makes no sense to have to re-type a script using other software that is Industry Standard.  Why not just buy a professional program and use it, from the beginning.    I recommend Movie Magic Screenwriter, which formats for--among other types--films, stage plays, telvision producutions, multi-media productions and animations...and also meets Industry Standards for working with various elements of productions.  It also imports and converts scripts written in Word, WordPerfect and other formats; so there is no need to retype a script.

(Received an early copy) I must admit the upgrade experience is a hassle but once you install Windows 7 you will be pleasantly surprised. I recommend a clean install for all users. Windows 7 has a noticeably snappier boot time than Windows Vista. What users will notice most are the changes to the interface. It took some time to get adjust new taskbar but once I became familiar with the new interface, I found it to be an improvement over previous Windows versions. Windows 7 also includes a comprehensive device drivers, I have only had an issue with an old printer where Windows 7 could not find the drivers. But with Virtual XP this was no problem, I simply installed the Virtual XP, and used my printer within the virtualized environment. I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used.    Improvements/Pros/New Features  -New Taskbar interface, each program is represented by an icon for a clutter free taskbar  -Quicker boot times  -Comprehensive driver library  -Supports many devices out of the box  -Less annoying  -Virtual XP (for those who still need Windows XP)  -Networking    Recommendations  -Microsoft Security Essentials: A free antivirus program provided by Microsoft that fights viruses, spyware, rootkits, and Trojans. This program is a separate installation, and is also compatible with XP, Vista, and 7.    -Ninite: Free program that provides easy PC Setup, and helps to install Multiple Applications at once.

I have read some negative reviews posted here and I believe that you should take serious consideration in the beta tester's opinions. I have beta tested QuickBooks 2007 and I believe this to be an excellent product with exceptional value. Yes, it is true that you must upgrade to the enhanced payroll service in order to e-pay, but I feel the $299 cost is well worth it. Remember you get constant updates from your state and federal agencies. There is also an upcoming patch that will allow you to e-file your forms. Most problems arise from not completely uninstalling previous versions of QuickBooks. Once you have installed this version correctly, you will be happy with it's functionality!	2006-11-25

This software is very so-so, and not anywhere near as simple and convenient compared to TrueImage. Furthermore, the boot/recovery program whether from CD or hard drive, fails to work 50% of the time whether from not booting or not recognizing your hard drives. The boot program for True Image is slicker and much more polished and is nearly the same as the Windows version (done in a nice Vista style) whereas Perfect Image gives you a clunkier and less polished UI when booting directly to it.     A major irritant is the product validation which runs every time and will render the software useless if there is any problem or computer hardware upgrade. Your only option is to contact Avanquest and they will get around to responding to you. You are forced to request them to update their validation database so you can run 'your' program which is currently disabled. This process is quick, only 2 or 3 days to get it resolved.    One major advantage of Acronis TrueImage is that you can restore files, folders, all you want from the same backup image. You just can't do that with PerfectImage. So on that feature alone, why pay the same amount for less? Duh!	2009-05-17

Beyond the rock-solid UNIX underpinnings, the new features that I find most useful are:    1) Automatically add events to iCal from Mail.  This is a huge time saver for those who get appointment notifications by email.    2) Time Machine works great and it is no longer necessary for me to use my old ad hoc terribly unsafe backup scheme. This feature alone is worth the upgrade.    3) Mail & iCal.  The new version of mail is very fast, and the ability to have nested and smart folders is a plus.  iCal's changes are great and the app. is now ready for prime time.    4) Apache2 and PHP is included, which isn't going to help most users but if you are web developer you'll appreciate that.      5) Spaces.  Having multiple working desktop spaces is great for multitasking.    6) New Look and Feel.  It's very polished.  I like the black dock on the side better than the default, and it is absolutely necessary to turn off the default \\"preview\\" desktop icon view, but overall look is great.    7) iChat screen sharing is awesome for collaboration over the internet.  Going to meetings is going to be obsolete if they keep this up!    Overall, it's worth the upgrade price, especially since they've already released 10.5.1, which ties up a few  loose ends that were in the original version.	2007-11-29

Every year I buy the new Norton Anti-virus, submit a rebate, and end up paying nothing...or maybe just a little sales tax.  It installs perfectly every time.  I have never needed support.  Every year it gets better, does more, etc.  NAV 2010 is no different.  Just installed it on 3 PCs and it was a piece of cake.<br /><br />I have tried McAfee, and it consumes way to many resources.  I have noticed a performance difference on my PC.  I have to use McAfee on my corporate PC, and it has malfunctioned across thousands of PCs, causing all kinds of outages.  I don't trust it.  I have tried 3 or 4 of the free ones and they only do the basics.  A couple of them have let viruses through.  Some of them pop up ads all the time.  Who needs that?  Even the free ones now require you to renew every year, and then they pressure you to buy their 'premium' offering.<br /><br />I have never had a virus while NAV was installed.  It has stopped quite a few, though.<br /><br />Don't listen to the haters who don't read the instructions, or don't like the business model of NAV being a 1 year subscription.  They're all going to go to that model to make money.	2010-07-13

Systemsuite has been excellent!  I have installed and uninstalled it several times without ever having any problems, the antivirus updates frequently, usually no longer than 2-3 days (Mcaffee and Norton usually update only once a week)and all the utilities work perfectly.  The program comes with several extra utilities (Ghost Surf, PowerDesk, Recovery Commander, and MailWash) but you DON&quot;T HAVE TO install these if you do not want to.  You also can choose to install either the antivirus or firewall, both, or neither, and the utilities work with other firewalls and antivirus programs if you already have other favorites.(Just remember to have ONLY 1 antivirus and 1 firewall running, whatever you choose!)As I said, I don't know why some people had such problems with this, but after using several similar products, I feel this is the best currently available.	2004-02-21

The Trend Titanium Maximum Security 2012 version (For 3 PCS) has created many headaches for my older PCs running XP. I wasn't able to uninstall the 2011 version without it disabling my internet connection and then I was doing System Restore to get it connecting. I used the tools that they provided and once the version expires you cant uninstall it from Control Panel. 2012 then would not install, errors galore. Not a bad CD, just totally bad experience. The latest products starting with 2011, also place a huge demand on the OS and PC performance.<br /><br />On the plus side, I felt secure in the knowledge that Trend Titanium Maximum Security 2011 did make me feel safe about my PC and it's safe performance was never in question.<br />Trend's support team gave me the newer version a couple of months ago when it seemed the 2011 version was killing my newest Gamer PC. Of course, it took a bit of deleting installations using their extra online tools. (Which didn't work on other PCs). The 2012 version was also a process killing application. Boot times were extremely slow and laborious. The remnants of it are also resident on that PC since it cannot be removed without destroying my connectivity.<br />I am not going to be a \\"Trend\\" customer in the future.<br /><br />Amazon and their partners are always the best! No drag on their products or delivery. Best Customer Experience-always.	2012-09-01

This is for people that don't care to tap in their drum patterns with a MIDI controller, or go through the tedious task of mouse-clicking through a piano roll style MIDI editor.  I've used the drag-drop interface with Reaper with no problems.<br /><br />The drum sounds are pretty good, certainly a step up from the other MIDI drums I've used.  Individual kit pieces sound OK, and the overheads and room mics provide for some good flexibility.  The quality of the samples is good but not excellent, and I'm already tempted to cross-grade to Superior Drummer for access to better samples, the ability to mix and match kit pieces, and better routing control.<br /><br />The main drawback of EZD, other than the &#34;just OK&#34; samples, is the way that they implement the hi-hat control.  Only certain hi-hat trigger notes are able to be controlled effectively with the mod wheel of a MIDI controller to adjust the &#34;openness&#34; of the hi-hat.  Most of the hi-hats respond to the mod wheel, but immediately forget the wheel position as soon as the wheel stops moving.  So you can't just set a hi-hat pedal position and go.  There are only certain hi-hat &#34;trig notes&#34; that allow for a set-and-forget mod wheel position.  A little weird, but serviceable.<br /><br />I just use a MIDI controller keyboard and a liberal amount of step-editing in a piano roll, but I've read that people have issues getting proper hi-hat expression pedal control from an electronic drum kit.  The members at the support forums are pretty knowledgeable and were a big help to me.<br /><br />And yes, the installation disc has some sort of bad installer on it, so you're best off just going straight to the Toontrack website, registering your product, and downloading the updated installer directly from them.  Definitely a pain for the customer.	2013-11-22

The chords they teach are simplified structures that are sometimes taught to children whose hands aren't big enough to reach the proper positions. The essence of beggining guitar is learning to stretch your hands to chord properly and finger memory-getting to the point where your fingers hit the chords without having to think about it. By teaching simplified chords and such, your time is wasted. You can quickly play a song but it doesn't sound right and you'll need to re-learn all your chords.	2000-08-10

I am in the market for a good accounting software package; I was an Intuit (Quicken and Quickbook PRO)user some years ago when I had my business and we used it from the time that it was in its infancy right up to the time we closed our doors in 2003. It was a wonderful program and made handling our financial affairs so easy.    After having read these reviews, I must admit I'm a bit dismayed with what I read, not just from the comments of the customer, but with the remarks from the Intuit people themselves. My first Intuit Quickbooks cost me less than $40.00 and my last update was about the same price. At that price, a concise manual was included that answered almost all questions. I rarely had to use customer service or tech help. What disturbs me is that I don't think Intuit is listening to what all of you are complaining about. It's almost like Intuit is giving you cookie cutter answers to your comments.    Call me ignorant or naive, however, I don't currently have a bit of software that requires me to pay extra for email service, kills some of the features because of possession of an older version, or sets hurdles to force me to consider purchasing an upgrade. This never used to be what Intuit was about. The answers and comments Intuit is providing you is simply unacceptable to me. Instead of justifying why Intuit is nickle and diming their users, why don't they just come out with a program that includes the most popular services for free and add $20 or $30 to the retail price? I believe that would certainly calm down the dissatisfaction and a way to minimize the bad press. Has Intuit factored bad press into their equation? Have they forgotten that the reason they became so popular over the years was because of the positive word of mouth recommendations from their users? You're making bad moves Intuit. So sad...	2011-08-18

My copy came in a USB flashdrive. Only problem encountered is that Parallels requires an Apple external dvd/cd drive to install Windows Home Premium 7 64-bit. It did not allow me to install it from a different brand. This player works perfectly for other purposes though. Another option is to crate an .iso file of the operating system. It was successful although it required me to download another program to create the .iso file. There are not a lot of programs running on the windows side; maximum of 2 financial programs. If there was slowness in the system, it is very minimal and may be tolerable for just running the basic programs. Another point to mention is that I saved the virtual system in an external hard drive and not on the iMac itself. I recently connected an external monitor and works perfectly as well. I have this system for a week now and has not encountered any issues.	2013-05-26

I use Quicken Rental Property Manager to do my record keeping and TaxCut Premium (the name that Block used for this software for years) to do my taxes. The data export/import process is very simple and correctly imports my data for Schedule E as individual properties, something that older versions of TaxCut could not do; in the past TaxCut lumped all of the properties into one property on Schedule E. Since I had used TaxCut in previous years, TaxCut also imported my personal data from last year so a lot of my return was filled in before I ever really started working on it. I have found that if I spend the time to make sure that the Quicken data is correctly categorized before I import the data into TaxCut, I can do the actual return in only a few hours, a very reasonable length of time considering the complexity of my return. I am very pleased. I tried TurboTax last year since it is made by the same company as Quicken, but it didn't seem do anything more for me or be easier than TaxCut so I never even finished the TurboTax return and used TaxCut to make my last year's filing. As long as Block continues to make this product, whatever name they use, I will continue to depend on it to do my taxes.	2014-05-25

US	36097625	R3CYWTS10QZ18O	B001URCHQ2	934901590	Civil War Battles: Campaign Chancellorsville - Windows	Software	5	19	19	N	N	Another Great Civil War Campaign from HPS	HPS Civil War Campaign games are the best Civil War battle games available for gamers and historians. Each game covers a major area of the war, with a series of historical and hypothetical battle games. These play as a single game or in a linked series of games making up a campaign.  In a campaign each game's losses and advantages carry forward forcing you to consider \\"tomorrow\\".  It is impossible to achieve victory in a campaign by attacking everything in sight or defending to the death every time. In campaign mode, decision points determine the direction the campaign takes, while battles determine the next set of decision points available. This provides almost unlimited replay as no one campaign will ever produce the same set of outcomes and decisions.<br />Game scale is set to the pace and command abilities of the 19th Century. Each turns is twenty minutes during the day and one hour at night, about 120 yards per hex. Units are infantry or cavalry regiments with large regiments often split into two counters.  Artillery batteries can be sections or full batteries, depending on the game.  Leaders exist from Brigade to Army.  There is a chain of command and keeping brigades in division and divisions in corps is beneficial.  Supply wagons provided needed ammunition for infantry units.  Artillery ammunition is set for a game and conservation is always a consideration.  Formations, while limited, are a constant consideration.  Being in line or column, limbered or unlimbered, mounted or dismounted enhance movement or combat and require planning and preparation. Being in the wrong formation will mean you cannot fire, take more casualties or move slowly.<br />Movement starts at about two miles an hour for an infantry regiment. Terrain, roads and formation increase or decrease this rate.  Combat results in losses and fatigue. Fatigue makes units susceptible to disorganization or route. Disorganized units are less effective and more likely to route. Routed units run from battle and will not fight until rallied. Leaders can rally units and have the best chance of doing so when they within their chain of command.<br />This is a turn-based game with players alternating turns.  During each turn, the other side has a chance to fire on you, possibly disrupting your plans.  The challenge is not to see how fast your mouse clicks but to control your units, stay in formation and break or hold the line.<br />While this may sound complicated, it is not.  A basic set of easy to learn rules is common to all the games.  As new rules are added, HPS updates previous games and incorporates the new rules that apply to this game.  In addition to the \\"official\\" HPS site, a number of \\"fan\\" sites exist providing additional games, improved graphics and play by email opponents.  These items are addition to the supplied games designed for solitaire play and an AI that constantly improves, do silly things and you will suffer unpleasant consequences.<br />Graphics are not up to Dawn of War II standards.  This system is not about great graphics but about historical feel and play.  The \\"WOW factor\\" is not in detailed figures and buildings.  It is in detailed historically accurate maps and great game play that gives us the feel of commanding Civil War armies in battle.<br />Campaign Chancellorsville covers the Battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville the late fall of 1862 to the early summer of 1863.  This game has two very large maps of the battlefields, Chancellorsville is 168 x 99 and Fredericksburg is 275 x 199.  These maps give us over 100 standalone games and 4 different campaigns with a \\"weather variant\\".  In addition to the historical games is a series of \\"what if\\" games of battles that could have occurred.  Another feature is meeting games, where the map and the other side are unknown.  You simply \\"meet\\" and have to decide what to do.  A group of games is specifically designed for solitaire play. The AI has very specific instructions taking full advantage of the its' strengths while masking any weaknesses.<br />Fredericksburg has a game that requires the Union player to cross the river and take the town or stop them from doing so.  This is the first opposed river crossing in the U.S. Army's history and I am happy to see it included, often Fredericksburg games never addressed this difficult item.  Chancellorsville includes the fighting around Fredericksburg in addition to the main battle.<br />Campaign Chancellorsville slips between Campaign Antietam and Campaign Gettysburg, allowing us to fight the war in the East from the fall of 1862 to the summer of 1863.  This is a major addition to this game series and is well worth adding to your collection.  If you do not have a collection, this is a good starting point.  Now if you will excuse me, it is May 1,1863 and I am trying to extend the Union line south from Chancellorsville in the face of increasing opposition.engths while masking any weaknesses.

If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so.  Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced.  Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs.  Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or \\"Features\\" as they are called by the company.<br /><br />Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better.  Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything.  You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple.  I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix.  I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer.  If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.<br /><br />To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation.  If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little.  Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work.  Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive.  Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!<br /><br />Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag.  I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed.  Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox.  Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business.  Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive.  Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.<br /><br />For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista.  I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced but under that pretty surface is a code full of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.won't freeze before you can save it!

I found this to be a useful program, as long as you don't trust it explicitly. Like all utilities, it's only good for so much, and then it can create all kind of problems for you.

The FaceFilter Studio 2 software would not install, requiring my attempt to obtain support.<br /><br />The support person was condescending in the response. I finally found that the FaceFilter Studio 2 install form required a non-blank character (any character except a space) in the Company name field of the install form to actually begin the install.

If you do go against this advice and that of other reviewers, keep the box so you can request a refund.<br /><br />Seeing a sales price I decided to purchase Fix-It Pro 12. Once installed, problems developed on my Win 8 computer. I went through the update process and ended up with version 14. This update did not help. I uninstalled and reinstalled the downloaded version 14--again, problems. Therefore, I've uninstalled and have almost corrected and fixed the problems caused by Fix-It.<br /><br />When installed, I noticed several icons disappeared off the desktop and several apps disappeared off Win 8. My Outlook button on the taskbar disappeared and the icon on the desktop would not call up Outlook--I had to go to the menu. Some progams, such as Firefox, had to be reinstalled. I experienced freezes of programs and several times had to reboot by using the PC power button. I noticed the boot up time was slowed when Fix-It was installed. When attempting to enter Control Panel to uninstall Fix-It, the desktop menu could not open Control Panel; luckily I was able to access Control Panel via Win 8 search.<br /><br />When I uninstalled Fix-It, the computer returned back to health--none of the above problems occurred. When I reinstalled version 14, problems occurred once again. This time the Fix-It deleted the Fix-It set-up program from the Windows temporary directory. Therefore, I have permanently uninstalled Fix-It and have contacted Avanquest for a refund.<br /><br />Regarding the process of requesting a refund: I did send e-mails and information was sent on getting a refund. My issue was that I had discarded the box (which does look nice) and had no bar code, which is required to obtain a refund. I decided to chat and I was given a barcode to enter--for version 10. I did enter the form but noted the printed copy asks for a barcode from the box. Therefore, I'm doubting a refund will come but maybe the folks Avantquest will surprise me.<br /><br />If you wondered why Fix-It earned one star in this review, it is because a manual does come with the CD. I wish other companies would package a manual. As for the Fix-It program, I found it a waste. I should have stuck to my plan and purchased System Mechanic rather than getting Fix-It at the sale price.<br /><br />To summarize: I experienced similar problems as other Amazon reviewers have noted. Therefore, I give the same advice numerous others have given-- do not buy because Fix- It causes more problems than fixes.<br /><br />Note: I have owned PCs since the DOS 5.0/Win 3.1 days. I have installed operating systems, including various flavors of Linux. I have installed many software programs and have set up network devices and installed components on PCs. I can truly say this has been one of the worst software packages I've ever installed.	2013-02-15

Studying web design in school and being able to work from home on my desktop definitely helps things along. My school only has this suite installed on Macs with one screen. Well this set of software with multiple monitors is a dream come true. It has 15 different applications that come with it. It is essentially the equivalent of getting Microsoft Office Suite for word processing, only instead of word processing it helps you have all the tools to make really great looking websites. However there is a learning curve. But the internet makes things easy to learn the basics and there is plenty of information to help get you started. The activation for this product took 10 minutes maximum. You fill out the proper forms and give them your school email address and then you are sent the activation code. These products really do have a lot of polish about them. Is it worth the price? Absolutely because it will pay for itself when you continue using this program for years to come. If you are a student or professor I would highly recommend this product. Think about it this way, New text books cost somewhere along the lines of 300 to 500 dollars a semester. This software will last you far more than half a year. It will last you 3 maybe 4 years before you want to purchase a newer version of the software. 360/3 is 120 dollars a year. That's not to bad at all. I would whole heartily recommend this product especially if you are going to use the software well.	2011-12-01

I ordered the CS5 Extended upgrade for 349.00 (per all the drop downs).  Hmmm, I thought, that's weird, since I own CS4 (not extended).  Sure enough, when I tried to install it \\"not a qualifying product.\\"  Called Adobe Customer support which really does get a prize for the Unfriendly Tone of Voice.  After going through her script (which was what she knew how to do in a frosty tone of voice), I got a code to \\"unlock\\" my install, which was, in fact, an okay install.  Then I asked, \\"Will I have the same problem on my Desktop?\\"  She wanted to stick to the script and give me the case number but I said, \\"oh, hey, let me just try it.\\"  Same problem, saved myself an extra call.    All is well because installed.  But the communication is not exactly state-of-the-art. Adobe still hasn't pulled up its socks in this area.  Wonder how many of these it handled today?	2010-05-18

Other than that, it provides all the book keeping features a small business will look for.  The help section may need some help.  When I tried to find how to enter sub accounts, it did not give me an answer.  My conclusion was that you cannot use sub accounts, which makes using sub totals not flexible.

I just bought one of those Dell all-in-one desktops about two years ago and the thing was already starting to run slowly. I mean, start up was so slow I could cook dinner before getting to the desktop screen--it runs on Windows 7 XP. Web pages were constantly getting those \\"Stop Script\\" errors. I had a bunch of pop-ups. All in all, it was a mess and I wasn't sure how to address. I thought I had a virus but the virus software didn't detect any issues. So when I saw this software I thought it was worth a try before I reinstalled the entire operating system.<br /><br />Well, I ran a full optimization and Norton worked like a charm. I'm far from a techie and don't know every process it goes through but whatever it does, it worked. My start up time is almost lickety split compared to what it was before. My internet runs great and doesn't get hung up...neither do my programs. I no longer feel the need to reinstall the operating system and start from scratch. The only thing mildly annoying is that it started running checks without me initiating it, but the quick fix was to set the scheduler so it runs scans while I'm asleep.<br /><br />If your system is running slow and you're a non-techie who doesn't have a clue about what's going on, I would say that this is definitely worth a shot.

This issues also exists with the 2015 products.<br /><br />I recently contacted Intuit with respect to issues I am having with their Home and Business product. The primary issue is with respect to the ability, or should I say the inability to download transactions from a financial institution.  I spent over an hour with someone on the other end of a chat window trying to resolve this issue.  I would have preferred to talk with someone but as the chat person stated, &#34;we don't offer Phone Support anymore.&#34;<br /><br />My first issue is related to the fact that I cannot download transaction from one of my financial institutions, I receive a generic CC-503 error, which Intuit states in their KB article as an incorrect ID or password.  In fact, the ID and password that is entered is correct, both work if I log into the website from a browser (both the IE-based browser within Quicken and externally through another browser).  This clearly proves that the ID and password is correct.  The chat engineer stated that Quicken &#34;has trouble handling special characters in passwords.&#34;  This means that if your financial institution requires a special character in your password (like mine) then you probably won't be able to automatically download transactions into Quicken. First, the chat engineer blamed this issue on the financial institution, then he stated that this is a &#34;restriction of the software&#34; and that if I use the software in the way it was intended I would not have this issue.  Finally he stated that a special character “just adds the Security Level of the Password consistency.&#34;  Isn’t that the point of adding the special character?  Would you want to support the highest level of password security you could?  Why is Intuit writing software that is limiting security? And if more and more financial institutions are supporting special characters, and some requiring them, then why would Intuit write code that limits your ability to increase yoursecurity?<br /><br />Intuit advertises that you can download transactions from financial institutions, and then they tell you that they don't support the latest security requirements and they have placed limitations in their software to prevent people from being able to enhance their security posture.  Is this really the type of company we should be supporting?	2015-01-02

But I keep going back to Peachtree.  There are times when I would NOT recommend Peachtree (if you need to use it on a MAC...if you need a particular 3rd party software that doesn't integrate with Peachtree...etc).  But I find Peachtree (now Sage) to be extremely reliable.  I especially like the logical layout.  By comparison QB is a confusing mess.  One thing I don't like is that starting in 2013 Peachtree no longer includes the &#34;manual payroll option&#34;.  That hurts.  But I understand why.  Quickbooks and Peachtree make money with their &#34;automatic payroll&#34; systems.  You won't know for several weeks or months if you like your new QB or Peachtree software.  It is important to read these reviews and look for &#34;land mines&#34;.  In my experience Quickbooks is full of &#34;land mines&#34; that explode at just the wrong time (i.e. &#34;your ability to email attachments no longer works.

It's got some great new features, there's no new interface to learn, and it can switch between 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Granted, this is a major pain when you have the audacity to want to add some lighting effects and have to close the program down, adjust the settings to 32-bit, then restart it and do what you want to do, before closing it, resetting it to 64-bit, and getting back to what you were doing.    So why, aside from those irritations, am I giving a program with 4-5 star features a paltry 2 stars? (4-5 star functionality, I should note, for my PERSONAL needs. There are scads of problems with CS5 borking printer and scanner drivers, and producing inconsistent prints that are simply unacceptable for those who do lots of printing work. I don't. Your needs and mileage may vary.)    Because even though it is a Mac program, it doesn't really play nice with Macs. At least, it doesn't play nice with NEW Macs. So, with that in mind...    A WORD OF WARNING -- do NOT upgrade yet if you have a computer that uses an i-Series processor! There are known incompatibilities between this processor series and CS5, which the latest patch/update has done NOTHING to fix (though it did smarten up the ridiculously laggy Liquify tool a little). I have a 2.66GHz MacBook Pro with an i7 processor and 4GB of RAM, with Photoshop being given a separate 1TB scratch disk. There is no reason why this system should not be able to handle a program like Photoshop CS5, especially when it's the only program running save for iTunes and Safari. AND YET...    Every. time. I use CS5, it ends up lagging not only Photoshop, but EVERY other program on my computer, necessitating mass Force Quits and a complete restart (sometimes cold, because the system refuses to respond to anything else). \\"It might be something else!\\" I hear you cry. Well, this ONLY happens when Photoshop CS5 is running. It does not happen at any other point; the system handles beautifully, so long as CS5 is not involved.    Unfortunately, Adobe is not exactly fast about getting this compatibility issue fixed. I would recommend that users with i-Series processors hold off on this upgrade until the company actually does something about it; CS3 was really the last build that worked on an i-Series processor without a host of issues. It has, however, been reported to work fine on the Core 2 Duo machines of builds past, so it may be worth a try there.    But if you have an i-Series, I strongly recommend you obtain a trial version of the software first, to see if the (absurdly) high price tag is still acceptable given the low performance.	2010-09-15

It is Brazilan... which has a VERY different pronounciation and words.  As Amazon listed several different Portuguese products, some labeled \\"Brazilian\\" and some not, that clearly indicated that the ones that were not labeled Brazilian should have been standard (continental) Portuguese.  VERY misleading by Amazon.  They should immediately label all of these products with a \\"Brazilian\\" label.  I am very surprised they didn't do this after the very first compliant.    In reading the first reviewer, I am shocked to see they contacted Rosetta Stone and they didn't even offer standard Portuguese!

I purchased the Premium version of TaxCut for $39.99, and I would not employ the term satisfactory, let alone Premium, (and I'm a Software Engineer).  One can't imagine what \\"Premium\\" features could possibly be missing from a \\"Deluxe\\" or \\"Basic\\" version, and still provide you with an accurate tax return. <br /> <br />I've typically filed my taxes with H&R Block's incredibly user friendly online service, but I saw this while in line at Best Buy (kudos to whomever strategically placed those TaxCut kiosks) and thought it might more thoroughly assist with deductions and credits available to homeowners.  Unfortunately, to get into detailed deductions you need to purchase the H&R Block TaxCut Deduction Pro for another $19.99.  Doubly unfortunate is the software's uselessness.  Deduction Pro's only functions are a) a spreadsheet where one might track contributions made to charity (a service a pen and piece of paper could perform equally as well);  and, b) to find out what the exact tax value is of those sneakers you donated to the Salvation Army or those magazines you donated to the library.  What most people do not realize is that you need to contribute several thousand dollars to charity or have several thousand dollars in medical expenses before these are tax deductible, and people who fall into these categories more often than not are having their taxes prepared by an accountant.  For the rest of use, Deduction \\"Pro\\" will advise you to take the Standard Deduction, rendering the program a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />TaxCut \\"Premium\\" does not include state tax software either-- you need to purchase TaxCut State separately for $24.99.  Because I work in New York and live in Connecticut, I needed to file state taxes in both states.  Unfortunately, the $24.99 only affords you access to one state of your choosing.  People like myself need to pay another $24.99 for the second state (and second TaxCut State purchase is not rebatable). <br />  <br />Then of course, there is the convenience of E-filing, for which TaxCut charges $15.95: $15.95 for Federal and another $15.95 for State.  E-filing is definitely worth it, so I coughed up the surcharge.  Unfortunately, I could not E-file my New York state return because TaxCut will not permit you to E-file Partial Year or Nonresident returns, which means you need to print everything (printing a simply copy of your completed return is another area of the program that proves less than simple) and mail it in yourself with all supporting documents. <br /> <br />Here's the kicker, folks.  After spending over $116 on poorly executed, user-UNfriendly, and in a few instances, inaccurate TaxCut software and e-filing, when TaxCut repeatedly gave me an error message and refused to open my file, I was forced to call Customer Support for which they charge $9.95 per call, not for tax advise, but for tech support when their software runs amuck!!  If you surf around the TaxCut website long enough, you eventually discover there is a free number.  When I phoned the \\"free\\" number (not toll-free, just free from credit card charges), I was on hold for 29 minutes before I was able to speak to a customer support agent.  I explained my tech problem and was then placed on hold for another 8 minutes while he discussed with his senior tech supervisor what the problem could be.  Ultimately the problem could not be resolved, and Mr. TaxCut's resolution was that I uninstall and reinstall the three software programs. <br /> <br />While I remain a big fan of preparing your own taxes with tax software and E-filing, DO NOT LET TAXCUT BE YOUR SOFTWARE OF CHOICE!!!!!	2005-02-04

It is light years ahead of any commentator, if there really are any real competitors.  I have used Painter since Fractal Designs first offered it and I wish I still had that paint can that the first version came in.  I have watched it tweeked with improved existing functions and new capabilities thru two decades.  When it was taken over by Corel I was concerned whether they would continue to support it and develop new capabilities.  I have since become very confident in Corel's desire and ability to support Painter and its loyal user base.  The only thing I have a problem with is how some new versions have not in my mind warranted putting out a new version instead of an update.  I wish that Corel would just update Painter continuously with online available updates to owners of the last version for at least two if not three years.  If you buy a piece of expensive software like Painter you should not have to buy an upgrade six or eight months later to get a new version with only a few improvements. I hate to pick on Corel only but the biggest change in this version is with the particle brushes, which again in my mind does not warrant a new version.  Having said that it is I suppose what we have to contend with to make Painter profitable enough for Corel to keep it alive and available.  As for anyone who has never used Painter and are in the market for a paint program for everything from professional work to artistic development you should explore what Painter has to offer.  Yes it is considerably expensive for the home user compared to many other paint programs available but none of those hold a candle to Painters' capabilities.  If you want to see a young artistically inclined child or young students eyes light up just sit them down and show them how to select and use the hose tool.  I have done this many times and each time I though I would never get them off the computer.  Even with my rant about updates I cannot bring myself to give anything less than the maximum stars, which it deserves.  I strongly recommend Painter but caution you that the more powerful you computer is the more pleasurable your experience will be and that if you have anything less than the suggested minimum CPU and memory you might want to get a new computer at the same time.bout updates I cannot bring myself to give anything less than the maximum stars, which it deserves.

In truth, there is very little difference between the looks (and featuers) of Office 97 and Office 2003 other than Outlook.  This is both good and bad.  It is good because upgrading is easier because you are already familiar with the user interface.  It is bad, because it leaves very little room for innovation which is why I'm rarely ready to rush out and upgrade my versions of Office.    Microsoft has decided this time around to not look like 2003 and I say this is all for the better.    But as an IT professional, I warn ALL of my users that upgrading does come with a learning curve and there is a difference in compatibility you need to be mindful of.  I would give anybody considering an upgrade the same advice.    I would like to mention the compatibility issues.  The standard \\"save\\" option will save your document in a format incompatible with previous versions.  This is similar to how Access 2000/2003 does not work with Access 97 databases.  Well, they have done this all over again except that you can open and save previous formats quite easily.  Just be mindful that when you save a Word or Excel document you need to save it in the prior format if you wish to share it with others.  You may need to do this for SEVERAL YEARS because I don't see this office being adopted quickly.  However, unlike the Access 2000/97 incompatibility, you can open, work in, AND SAVE Access 2000 databases.  I wish they had done this when Access 2000 first came out.  Thank you, Microsoft!!!    The interface is now completely different, especially since the toolbars at the top of the screen are named differently.  However, I like how your icons change depending on which toolbar you are working in which puts a lot of your features at the top of your screen without sacrificing desktop real estate.  I must admit, I have had to hunt for some things before (hmmm... where would sort and pivot table be?) but I've never had to hunt for too long.    Like every release of Outlook, this version has taken on a few changes.  And like every prior release, I love them!!!  Their current layout allows for viewing your Email, folders, calendar, and to-do list all on the same screen.  Navigation is quite easy and visiting your contacts couldn't be easier.  My only complaint is the notes... I wish they had done notes like they had done Contacts but they give you a little icon on the bottom of your screen that I often confuse with the \\"folder list\\" icon sitting next to it.  I hope Microsoft fixes that in a future patch/service pack.    Here is something else I've never said of previous versions... it has actually made my documents look better.  A lot better.  Formatting of text and columns has never been easier.  I use styles quite often and they aren't the \\"blah\\" standard ones anymore... the styles have evolved tremendously and my documents look great because of that.  Also, there was an ability to alternate shading in Excel but if you had to change orders or copy and paste it would ruin the shading and you had to re-do the shading all over again.  Now it keeps it just the way you want it... even on a cut and paste!!!    Despite the learning curve, I love this new version of Office and have no regrets switching over to it.  I think this has brought Office to a whole new level that no previous version has ever done before.  I can't believe I'm saying/typing this, but my hats off to Microsoft for coming out with a truly superior product.	2007-09-04

I have the Corel Paint Shop Pro XI and liked it in my old Dell Optiplex desk top with Windows XP but it doesn't want to run right on my new Dell Studio 17 with the Windows Vista. I thought since this was a newer program it would work better than the old one does with Vista. Wrong.<br /><br />It took for ever to install it. There must be something with the Windows Vista that isn't compatible with this program. I've only got it to open, after several minutes, a couple of times. The first time I got it to open it started scanning my hard drive collecting or importing all photo files, all video files, and all music files on the hard drive. It did this without my permission and there was no way that I could stop it. It should have let me choose what photo files and video files that I want to import. I definitely do not like a program taking control of my computer. It also used up just over a Gig of my hard drive with over 20,000 files in over 2000 folders.<br /><br />The few times that I've got it to run the Photo Paint Shop I haven't been able to save much of what I've used it for. The program usually stalls out and wont respond right in the middle of working on a photo loosing what work had been done. Then the only way that I can get it to shut down is opening the Task Manager and forcing it to shut down. What little that I have been able to use this program has been way over simplified actually reducing the usefulness of it and what it can do. So even if I could get it to run right there isn't anything that it can do better, or even as good as my other photo programs that were a lot cheaper than the price on this one. My Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10 is still the one that I use the most out of all the ones that I have. I haven't tried to use any of the video part of this program yet so I can't say much about it. But if its like the photo part it probably wont work right for me either.<br /><br />So any who, I don't know if it's in this program or in the Vista on my lap top, it wont work for me. It probably will work with XP but I dont know and I don't have enough space on the hard drive of my old desk top to try it in that one. So if it works for you, great. But if you are running Vista on your computer I suggest that you try something else.ho, I don't know if it's in this program or in the Vista on my lap top, it wont work for me.

When HGTV's Home & Landscape Platinum Suite software says \\"no design experience necessary,\\" they mean it. This software has almost everything you might need to decorate your existing home or design a new home, even if you've never done it before.     When you open the box, you find a number of items in addition to the actual software. There is a website link provided where you can get started fast by viewing step-by-step video tutorials. As a person who hates to use the online \\"help\\" menu, I was excited to find an actual paperback User Manual inside the box. At 698 pages with a helpful index, it's a rare find in software packages these days.     The software downloaded fast and it's way more detailed and realistic than I expected. You can start with actual pictures of your own home or use one of the software's over 10,000 home plans.     This software is addictive! Practically any decorator item you can imagine is included, from gravel and dirt to wallpaper and even the sheets on the bed. As a girl who loves gardening, the plant encyclopedia was an exciting find. No more buying a plant for a shady area that needs full sun.     The coolest feature was the lighting. When you place lighting within a room design, it lights the space so you can see where the light will illuminate down (or up). Whether you're placing track lighting, candles, or floor lamps, you can immediately see if it's lighting the space like you want.     While this software is easy to use, it is vast. If I started over from the beginning again, I would either read the \\"Read Me First\\" brochure that comes with the software or head over to the website that provides video tutorials instead of just jumping in.      I look forward to the many hours I'm sure I'll spend redesigning and redecorating my home with this addictive software. If my bank account could just keep up with all of these cool ideas!

It does not tell you that e-filing of the state tax is not included and will cost an additional $39 after you are done with the return. For Colorado, the state return does not include all forms and you must mail them to the state. Why did I pay $39 to e-file the state return and them have to mail some forms? I could have mailed the entire return in for 44 cents.    You cannot contact or get support from customer support. One hour wait three times to finally be told that \\"we don't know\\".    Hung up on during \\"chat\\" without ever typing a word.    DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, THERE ARE BETTER ON THE MARKET AND THEY WILL SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT.	2010-03-04

I decided to buy the CD version as I do not like to use the on-line service which is much more discounted through my bank.  It was cheaper from amazon than any other site.  Arrived promptly and installed without problems. After first install it took a long time to update, I almost thought that the computer crashed.  Since then it has updated 2 more times, much faster updates...<br /><br />It walks you through your taxes step by step, I have been using turbo tax since 1998 and have no other programs to compare to.	2013-02-19

We found that out the hard way by calling Rosetta Stone.  The representative said that any of their products are not guaranteed unless bought directly from their website or stores.  Ouch!<br />  The reason we wanted to return it is that the written portion of the program is in Korean characters and not Romanized.  Therefore, it's very hard to understand the details of things being said.  We turned to a different system and it's working much better!	2008-02-06

I completely destroyed my hard drive forcing an entire reinstall of Windows. It caused the following error: Acronis Loader Fatal Error: Boot Disk (partition) not found.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be able to recover everything from an external hard-drive.  Unfortunately, in order to recover the data, I had to reluctantly install it again with as few options as possible.  This time, it was almost impossible to uninstall all traces of the software. I had to go thru yet another reinstall of Windows, but had recovered all my data else where.  NOTE: There is no uninstall program that completely removes the software!<br /><br />It was supposed to protect my data and computer, not destroy it!<br /><br />Buyer beware.

I'm a seasoned web developer. Everything I was able to do on Windows 7, I can do on Windows 8 + more.<br /><br />The start menu has been replaced by the start screen (the tiles) which revitalizes the originally intended functionality: get to what you need, fast.<br /><br />- The OS is blazing fast compared to Windows 7.<br />- I still have 100% the desktop functionality I was used to in Windows 7; and it's improved.<br />- I can still open files with the programs I choose.<br />- ctrl-shift-esc still brings up the task manager - but it's 10x better. More detailed, easier on the eyes, better information hierarchy, more options.<br />- I can pin programs to the start-bar just like I did in Windows 7.<br />- I've got the start-bar search no matter where I am ( now called the search charm ) and it's contextual.<br />- I can run more software than I could in Windows 7. Windows 8 has better plug-n-play support; utilizes touch input for screens that support it; runs any program Windows 7 could run and is compatible with Windows 8 'apps'.<br /><br />Small learning curve, but *very* intuitive after that; I've caught myself swiping down on my android device in attempt to close an app!<br /><br />5/5. Can't wait to see what Microsoft comes up with next.	2013-01-31

I started using Adobe software more than 20 years ago. It's senseless to review software at a point of purchase.  We all know what Adobe software is about. What is important is the purchase experience. I upgraded my CS4 Design Premium to the CS5 Master Collection to keep up with my job requirements. Little did I know that Adobe would announce the CS5.5 upgrade three days after I registered this software. The good news is there was no problem obtaining a free upgrade to the CS5.5 Suite from Adobe, which would have otherwise cost $299. All Adobe required was a dated receipt of the Amazon purchase. There you are, buy with confidence from Amazon. But then, you already knew that.	2011-06-06

Even if you have already purchased this program, DO NOT INSTALL IT. Yes your money may be gone but your data will still be there. This program has rendered systems UNBOOTABLE. Meaning for some people who are not tech-savvy, they will be reformatting their drives and reinstalling Windows. <br /> <br />There is a case to be made that this is in fact a defective product. I would not be surprised to see a class action lawsuit. Wouldn't you be upset if you had to reformat your hard drive after trying to install software meant to protect you? As to the five star ratings you will find here - they are likely employees for the vendor (Symantec), so beware. <br /> <br />There are better ways to protect your data in any case, since even if you are running a utility, your hard drive can still fail. A simple method is to store photos etc at an online service that stores them at their original size. This way if your system fails, you can still get the photos back. Same for other types of documents - you can use Yahoo Briefcase, Gmail, burn to a CD, etc. At the very least, store your data on a separate hard drive (D: etc) distinct from that upon which you installed your OS (C: etc), so if you have to reformat/reinstall software, your data remains intact. <br /> <br />Symantec should be pulling this product from the market, they must obviously know at this point the product is defective and will destroy many users' systems. Oh and if you want to call them and tell them you will be paying for the call. How this product made it through testing is beyond me.	2005-04-13

Mostly, because of this program. I have to say, with the plethora of free weight management products out there, this is still my favorite. Since there are no longer updates and the manufacturer went stopped producing, there is no support. So you have to really want this item to buy it.

The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned. Customer Service exists but their reps claim they can't do anything about your problem. Their manners are less than acceptable. Rude seems to be the \\"in-thing\\" at this company. As consumers, we have options; one of which is to ge elsewhere. I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned. It's too bad.	2007-02-13

Pyro is a no-frills CD ripper. The version that I purchased (2.0.1) seems reasonably stable compared to other CD-ripper programs. The MP3 converter quality is acceptable at 192bits (I don't bother with anything lower than that).<br />The interface is unwieldy, non-intuitive and often aggravating. Suprisingly, it doesn't appear to have any playlist features. This means that once I rip my CDs, I end up adding them to my playlist in MUSICMATCH and listening to them there. The audio edit features have come in handy in a few cases. It's nice to be able to cut out parts of a song, or split it up into multiple tracks. However, the lack of playlist or library features limits the value of the product.	2003-10-01

They simply use this package because it is the \\"industry standard\\" instead of actually looking at a package that suites their needs. If you are an interviewer and someone says they also use Paint Shop Pro then you should actually listen to them for not toeing the official line. You might learn something there that will save you time, money and wasted space. Why bother training people for a couple of months to learn this package when they can do your intermediate tasks on a package they can use out of the box?

Note: about checking your filing if S Corp earnings	Unusable.  The software stopped working correctly due to an update.  2 buttons are stuck on &#34;yes&#34; and there is no means for entering S-Corp income on the state tax form.  Previous entry made 15 days earlier disappeared and cannot now be entered.  The first tech refused to acknowledge the problems and told me to call the PA Dept. of Revenue. .  After 3 hours on the phone suffering from repeated attempted to deflect the problem, the tech finally observed the problem by operating the software and stated that he would escalate the problem. .  I then received two more calls from tech support which required me to again explain and demonstrate the problem.  I was told that the problem was escalated and that I would receive a follow up call the following day.  Having received no follow up call during the following day, I called to follow up.  The tech again required me to explain the problem.  I was then told that the problem would be escalated and that I should call back if I do not &#34;hear from them&#34; within 5 days.  Upon reaching the corporate offices to inform management of the gauntlet of ineffective technical support for correction of software bugs, corporate attempted to transfer me back to technical support.     After 4 days I received an email to call to have the problem resolved.   I called to be informed that there is no problem with the software and instructions concerning how to override the program to enter my state S Corp income (working around the non-existent problem, and also eliminating the ability to e-file).    The problem verified by previous technical personnel was denied. Additional issue found:  If you have S Corp income and clicked the non-passive box for the S Corp,  you will still need to manually apply entry to ensure that the program did not assess the 3.8 investment tax on the S Corp income.  Do not buy.  Run away.  TurboTax works correctly with regard to all issues described above.	2015-04-23

According to the product specifications both on this page and the product box, this edition is compatible with the Windows Vista operating system. Actually, it's not. I learned, much to my chagrin, that it would be necessary for me to download an update from the Dragon website in order for the product to work. The download took almost two hours on a high-speed internet connection, as it's a huge file...essentially an updated version of the entire program.<br /><br />I attempted to install this product on my brand new Dell laptop, which -- again, according to both this page and the product box -- had more than enough processing speed to do so. I kept receiving an error message, telling me that it was not adequate, and therefore the installation was aborted. I went to the Dragon website, only to find out that any kind of support -- even via email -- costs money. What a nice surprise!<br /><br />Searching on Google, I found the source of my problem: I had to reconfigure my laptop's energy saving features so that the program would understand that there was enough processing speed in order to be installed. Once I did this, the program finally installed.<br /><br />From start to finish, the entire installation took around 10 hours, and that included a trip to a local computer store to check out the laptop, to make sure that my processor was working properly. I still haven't gotten the program to work, as there are problems with the microphone that I haven't figured out yet.<br /><br />It stands to reason that a very complex program such as this one is going to have a few bugs and problems. However, I've never had this many problems with any other software I've purchased, nor discovered to my chagrin that there is so little free support available for them. For those reasons, I cannot recommend this program for purchase.	2008-07-17

I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. Why? It's like having a hard copy of your office, even though it's not a disc, it is still better than having it digital and having amazon or microsoft keep a record that you bought. You have your proof of purchase right next to you either on your shelf, drawer, fireproof safe, etc.<br /><br />Next I've read a lot of the reviews and it seems there's a lot of hate on the download process. I've had a little issues myself but found a solution to my download issues. So I use Chrome, sure you're all familiar with it. amazing browser better than any other. I'm beggining to find a lot browsers are lacking a healthy amount of SIMPLE things that Internet Explorer can do. Like being able to click a box to select your language. I'm not angry that Microsoft has something only Internet explorer can do vs the other but more angry over the fact that my faster and better browsers don't have that kind of patch to it. SO, in short if you want the best experience with installing your microsoft office use the old Internet Explorer.<br /><br />Now  I have seen a good amount of reviews saying there is no manual or tutorial or something to explain their 2013 content. What it has or what it doesn't. I've dug deep and found they do have it but I don't think it's directly linked to microsofts website. This is something that should be fixed immediatly. something that can be seen that instant they search for more info on office. Just a simple &#34;For more info on this products content vists (insert url here).&#34; So for those of you who want videos or take a look at what the programs have to offer click this link below and read the instructions below that;<br /><br />https://support.office.com/en-us/article/training-courses-for-the-rest-of-the-Office-2013-programs-b8f02f81-ec85-4493-a39b-4c48e6bc4bfb<br /><br />I would recommend opening a new tab since getting back to this siteabove is at the bottom of the other tutorial sites. I've had a hard time understanding microsofts cloud called OneDrive and finally with these tutorials I know a lot more than I did before.<br /><br />Take note from what others say, you have to add your personal information. I did not have to do this. I simply signed in and customized office to kind of my preference (customization is very small, about two things). And if you are ask/required to do this simple task, it's not like they want your social, bank account or something similar to that.<br />Now for using Microsoft office it's kind of a different story. I'm in college and I can't say I need to use office right now but my university DEMANDS office 2013 which isn't fair. I know the others are better but some files aren't backwards compatible etc. etc. etc. then sad face. I will update my office experience over time since I will be needing to take some classes that need me to use office.<br /><br />But as it currently is, for the AVERAGE person, Office 2013 is just fine. There is nothing for you to worry about if you use it for average daily things.	2015-02-17

This is basically StudioPlus with Third-Party products SoundSoap and ProDAD as Plug-ins, plus a cloth that can be used as a \\"Green Screen\\" for Chroma effects.    Install was OK the first time around. ProDAD claims it won't work with my NVIDIA QUADRO 110. SoundSoap didn't work with their latest patch (11.1).     After wasting 5 hours on repeated calls with Pinnacle \\"Tech Support\\" (if you want to call it that), I finally gave up and went to BIAS, Inc - makers of SoundSoap. They fixed the problem in 30 minutes with a re-authorization key for SoundSoap.    The product is usable, with many sophisticated features. However, Pinnacle wants to nickel-and-dime the user every step of the way for certain effects and add-ons, which have to be purchased separately.    The product would be much improved with readily-available, friendly Customer support. This support is completely lacking from Pinnacle. It takes usually 30 minutes to get someone on the phone. Whoever answers seems to have been cultured to interact with a curious mixture of condecension and incompetence. On one occasion, I was put on hold, only to never be picked up again - a classic method for \\"resolving\\" calls without lifting a finger.    If I could, I would have returned the software by now. But since I can't, I'll stick it out and make it work.	2007-07-03

No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.<br /><br />I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to \\"successfully\\" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.sations with native speakers.

It was translated to English by Manga Gamer. Like Vol. 1, there are no possibilities for the reader to change the storyline by making decisions. Though some people call this a game, it is in fact a novel with a very complicated storyline.<br /><br />The chapters on this disc are 5. Meakashi-hen, 6. Tsumihoroboshi-hen, 7. Minagoroshi-hen and 8. Matsuribayashi-hen. While Meakashi-hen, which shows Sonozaki Shion's revenge for her first love, is (arguably) the most violent and cruel one of the eight original chapters, Tsumihoroboshi-hen is my personal favourite because it moves me to tears when I see Rena, the heroine of this chapter, fighting desperately for her happiness and her friend Keiichi trying to stop Rena from falling into madness and finding out something very important about himself. Minagoroshi-hen is my least favourite of all the chapters because it gets a bit boring sometimes, but its showdown is very intense and merciless. Matsuribayashi-hen finally solves all the mysteries and explains most things about the world of Higurashi. What I specially like about the Kai novel is the beautiful music, which was mainly composed by Dai, who wrote astonishing themes like \\"You\\", \\"Sora no Mukou\\", \\"Iru\\" and many others. The character design and the backgrounds are like they were in the previous chapters.<br /><br />Even if you know the anime or the manga, I can recommend the Sound Novel highly because you will get to know much more about the characters. This is because the story of each chapter is told as an inner monologue of the main character. The feeling is a lot different from the anime or the manga, where you watch things happen from the outside. In the Sound Novel, you experience the events from Shion's, Keiichi's, Rena's or Rika's point of view and you get to know their personal notions about the strange happenings in Hinamizawa.<br /><br />I can't sayanything about the quality of the translation, because I can't read the japanese version, but there are very few typos, so even a fussy reader like myself can enjoy this very much.<br /><br />For me, the Higurashi saga has become one of the most important stories which I ever read. It is more than a nice bit of entertainment; I think it's a great work of literature which hopefully will be explored and appreciated by many people around the world.	2013-07-10

I owned Dreamweaver MX, and then bought MX 2004.  Overall I'm glad I did, but I could see how some people might not need to upgrade.  I mostly like the changes in CSS.  It's added some wysiwyg functionally for certain CSS stuff.  It does seem slower to load though.  I run it on a 1.0GHz Pentium M Tablet PC with 512 MB of RAM and it takes a bit to come up but after it does performance is fine.  Then it also takes a while to close.  I really enjoy using macromedia though and would DEFINITELY recommend it over Frontpage which I used before I switched a couple years ago.<br />Also, I noticed some people complained that MX 2004 takes a REALLY long time to load.  I might add taht 7.0 was the original version released and then they released an upgrade to version 7.1  for free (that you can get at macromedia.com) and it is supposed to improve \\"overall performance and stability\\" according to macromedia, but the version I bought came with v 7.1 so I never experienced 7.0.

I guess for a program that costs  less than $200 you can't expect unlimited free tech support from US reps but it would be nice if you could get one on the phone once in a while or perhaps pay a little extra to speak to Americans only. We decided to pay the extra for QB Enterprise, not because we really needed it but because of the Tech support plans. It's amazing how good the Tech support is when your willing to shell out a couple thousand $$ and then agree to a $750 a year renewal fee. Still though, it's much cheaper than talking to my accountant and the Enterprise technical support is generally outstanding. They will go out of their way to make sure you have everything you could ever need. You still will sometimes get a goof ball if you call at odd hours and very occasionally when you call during normal hours in but for the most part everyone you speak to is located in the US.<br /><br />The product itself had some problems back in 2006 when they released this new type of QuickBooks. We quickly because frustrated with hosting issues, slowness, having to install it on our server, errors logging into the file etc..<br /><br />2008 however has been very good thus-far. It's not that big of an improvement although I do appreciate the fact that it integrates with Outlook. The new help system also seems to have a pretty big improvement. Some of the other complaints I've read seem mislead and/or petty...some of this is no doubt the poor technical support from India. For example, one person mentions that after 8 years they still can't import transactions. Sure you can! We've imported AR and AP transactions using import through iif. The tech support person we talked to sent us templates on how to get this done and while it's pretty clunky it gets the job done. Sometimes I can't get the \\"exact\\" report I want or I wish it did something a little better but the problem is that all businesses are different and it's impossible to have a program that will please everyone all the time.<br /><br />The things QuickBooks does well FAR EXCEED what it doesn't do. It makes accounting incredibly easy for a business owner, reports are pretty darn flexible. If their not flexible enough for you, upgrade to the Enterprise Edition and you get a Read ODBC driver that allows you to Query the database using SQL and make all sort of fancy reports in Access and Crystal. The biggest strength to this program is it's ability to be a jack of all trades. In one of the reviews someone is complaining about having to use Excel with QuickBooks to get the report they want but that is such a small gripe. The fact is that QuickBooks has a feature that allows you to export to Excel and customize things to your liking if you don't like exactly how they've done it. That's a benefit not a downside! They have taken the time to integrate with other products so well which I think is one of this products biggest strengths.<br /><br />The woman who has to rebuild her file repeatedly sounds like she has data damage in her file, something that has only happened to us once in 6 years and it was very minor. She also says she's getting a switch to message several hundred times? That's not normal. I've seen QuickBooks running on several hundred of my clients PCs without seeing that error. I can tell you from personal every day experience that the product runs fast if you take the time to set it up right, have decent computers (1-2gb of RAM is standard these days), and a decent server if your using a multi-user edition to hold the data file and take the \\"brunt\\" of the workload.<br /><br />If you have an anti-virus program make sure to have it exclude the QuickBooks processes! We had an issue with our file giving strange errors when we would open it that were similar to the switch-to message. The file was also running unbearably slow for a couple weeks. I eventually started booting the computers in selective startup and was able to determine the Anti Virus was at fault. I excluded the QBW32.exe process and everything has worked great ever since.<br /><br />The bottom line is that for users that already have 2006 or 2007, this is a small upgrade that's probably not worth it.

Orberg's Lingua Latina is the closest you will get to an Immersion method for Latin.<br />If Rosettastone want to produce an effective adjunct to the study of Latin, then they will have to radically redesign this course.

US	40472159	R2VYBTHAPBHRGL	B000A9QUXW	806374439	McAfee VirusScan 2006 Version 10.0 [Old Version]	Software	3	116	119	N	N	Essentially the same as versions 8 and 9.	There are two components to look at in McAfee VirusScan 2006, also known as version 10: The VirusScan component and the SecurityCenter component, also known by many as the blatant advertising component. <br /> <br />I'll talk more about SecurityCenter in a little bit. First let's review the actual virus scanning ability. <br /> <br />I was surprised when I pulled out the Quick Start Guide (which is the only guide that comes in printed form) and it did not instruct me to uninstall the previous version of VirusScan first. The last two or three versions have all said to do so. Maybe McAfee has finally worked through the issues that installing a newer version over an older version has always created. But I'm not one to take any chances. I still recommend not only uninstalling any previous McAfee VirusScan product on your computer, but also uninstalling ALL McAfee products. The conflicts that have been caused in the past by not doing this have been too great and too severe to take that chance. (WARNING: If you do uninstall your old VirusScan make sure you disconnect from the Internet first. There are too many viruses and worms out there today that can infect your computer just by simply being on the Internet. You can reconnect after you have installed VirusScan 2006.) <br /> <br />Even though I uninstalled all of my McAfee products first, I was able to install, update, and adjust the settings in less than 10 minutes. I experienced no problems with the set-up, or with conducting several test scans. <br /> <br />McAfee VirusScan 2006 is, for the most part, the same program as the previous version. The changes that were made back in version 8, which include the reduced number of settings to adjust, the reduced number of levels to navigate through, and the \\"virus map\\" feature, have been left relatively untouched. One welcomed improvement is the addition of a PUPs, or potentially unwanted programs, tab (you can find this by clicking on \\"Configure VirusScan Options\\" and then the \\"Advanced\\" tab). VirusScan will now notify you when it comes across a program it thinks might be unwanted. You can then tell VirusScan to remove the program or to add it to your trusted PUPs list, which you can manage. <br /> <br />This new version of VirusScan also comes with one major \\"update\\" change. Starting with VirusScan 2006, McAfee is now making DAT updates available nearly every day, instead of once a week or so as they have done in previous versions. Configuring VirusScan to install updates automatically will help to ensure that you have the most up-to-date virus fighting capability on your computer. For those with cable or broadband Internet connections, these updates are quick and should not interfere with any other surfing or downloading you are doing. If you have a dial-up connection, the update process will slow you down a little bit. <br /> <br />One update issue that first showed up back in version 8 and is still present in version 10 is when you choose to manually update. When you do this, and an update is available, VirusScan takes you to a McAfee page where you are suppose to log-in to continue. The problem is that the McAfee Website is notorious about refusing to log you out, even when you manually click the \\"log out\\" button on the site. So when VirusScan takes you to this page, and McAfee thinks you are already logged in, the page will tell you that you are already logged in but will not give you the ability to continue the update process. This happens to me about 80% of the time I try to manually update. For this reason, it's best that you allow VirusScan to automatically update itself if possible. <br /> <br />In all the years I have used McAfee VirusScan, I have never once had a virus or worm successfully download or install on my computer. For that reason, I give the virus scanning ability of McAfee VirusScan 2006 a 5-star rating. <br /> <br />So why the overall reduced rating? There are two reasons for it. <br /> <br />REASON 1: McAfee's customer service is one of the worst in any industry. Their live instant messaging help is a joke. The people who run this don't listen to your problem at all. They are only trained to have you run through a series of steps. Ask any current or previous McAfee customer about McAfee's customer service, and you are likely to send that person into a fit of hysterics followed by an hour-long commentary on just how awful their experience was. The last time I called McAfee customer service to fix a problem, their instructions screwed up my computer so badly that I had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everything. And once I did that, I then had to pay to talk to someone to fix the problem that I was having with their product. It took them 3 weeks, and five different phone calls to speak to five different people before I got the answer I needed. <br /> <br />REASON 2: SecurityCenter. This program wraps all of McAfee's products together for easy access on your computer's taskbar. It has also been the source of many a McAfee user's ire. The good news is that there has finally been some improvement with SecurityCenter. It used to be that when you started your computer, the McAfee SecurityCenter splash screen would tell you which McAfee security products you had purchased and which ones you had not. Many people did not like paying for a McAfee product only to have nothing more than a pop-up advertisement show up on their screen. During version 9, one of the updates sent out by McAfee changed the SecurityCenter splash screen so that you only saw what McAfee products were installed on your computer. VirusScan 2006 goes one step further and actually allows you to disable the splash screen. Unfortunately, if you open SecurityCenter it will still list the McAfee items you have not purchased and, as usual, cannot tell when other programs that do the same things as those McAfee programs have been installed on your computer. Most people will never have to open SecurityCenter since all of the programs can be opened by right clicking on the McAfee icon in the taskbar and selecting the program you need.   <br /> <br />Let me condense all of the above into the following: The PUPs detection notification and tab, along with the increased frequency in updates, are the only real changes in McAfee VirusScan 2006. If your previous McAfee VirusScan update is about to expire (you get one-year's worth of updates when you buy any VirusScan version) and you can find VirusScan 2006 with a good rebate, then it will probably be cheaper to buy the newer version than it will be to extend the old one. Otherwise, it won't hurt to wait for version 11 next year.	2005-09-19

However, the seller should have stated the DVD was a copy in the original listing.  I would not have purchased the DVD had I known it was a copy.  It would have saved me the hassle of returning it, waiting for the credit, etc.<br /><br />Whether or not the DVD would have performed as advertised, I will never know.

We are both using Windows 8.1. Installation was easy on both computers, but from there, we had completely different results even though both computers met all of the system requirements. While I was able to easily use the program, my daughter experienced a lot of lag which lead to her ultimately not being able to use the program on her computer.<br /><br />I currently use Corel Paintshop, so I'm familiar with layering and photo editing within the Corel platform. The Corel Photo-Paint program is okay for photo editing, but I still prefer a stand alone photo editing program. It's nice to have that option within the suite as it does give you the capability to edit photos and use them in the Corel Draw program (or elsewhere if desired). The Corel Draw does have a learning curve, but Corel provides a lot of tutorial videos and help that is built right into the program.<br /><br />If you're familiar with layering, you'll find it easier to use the program than if you've never done layering previously. The program has quite a few prebuilt templates available for download. You can use these as a starting point for projects or create projects from scratch. You have the ability to add some of the free clipart or digital images to projects, but you have to be connected to the internet as they need to be downloaded prior to use. Like many other programs, Corel has gone to the cloud to store images rather than package them with the program. If you have regular internet access and high speed internet, this is not an issue, but if you want to be able to work offline, you'll need to download graphics prior to going offline.<br /><br />The program itself has a wide variety of functions available to really customize your projects from beginning to end. It's important to note that projects created in the Home and Student edition are only for personal useand not for commercial purposes. If you need the ability to use the projects for commercial use, you'll need to get the full edition.	2014-10-28

About all I can say about this product is buggy, buggy, buggy.  That aside, I was also rather put off by the licensing agreement.  I'm one of those weird people who actually read the EULA.  The part that concerned me was the fact that the user can't sell any of the content -your own material- produced using this product without paying a (presumably huge) licensing fee to a third party.  I'm not talking about the music, movies or whatever that you're burning to CD's or DVD's.  I mean the software which converts, compresses or records the material into MPEG-2, MP3 and so on.<br />  Now, about the bugs...  I have used Easy CD Creator 4, 5 and a limited version of 6 for years with few if any problems.  I bought Easy Media Creator 7 to replace the basic version of 6 that came with my Plextor drive.  Big mistake!  It installed OK, but I went to open the program after the reboot and I got a message that my screen resolution was insufficient to run the application.  I had to increase it from 800 x 600 to at least 1024 x 768.  This made the text too small to read comfortably (I'm over 50) so I reset the display to large fonts.  Another warning!  Grrr... I'm NOT about to buy a new monitor just to use this program!  Somewhere along the line, the quick start icons in my task bar got stacked vertically and the clock began displaying the day and date, which together made the task bar about 2 inches high.  I couldn't change it back.  I also noticed that I could no longer read any of the dozens of DirectCD (UDF) CD-RW disks that I have photos and other data stored on.<br />  I tried formatting a CD-RW with the new program.  After watching the hourglass for several minutes without anything at all happening, I tried to abort the format.  The computer froze.  C'mon people, Windows XP just DOESN'T freeze!  I don't have a junk computer, it happily runs old and new programs without a hitch.  On the rare occasion a program does crash, it simply closes and everything else keeps going.  Not this time!<br />  Reboot again.  Uninstalled Easy Media Creator 7 and reinstalled. Same results.  Got tired of looking at the huge task bar that I couldn't fix, so I used the Win XP System Restore feature to bring the system back to the way it was a few days ago.  That effectively de-registered the Roxio app.  Deleted the directories it was in.  I considered reinstalling it again, but reconsidered and put everything back in the box.<br />  I almost never return things that I buy but this software had me so completely frustrated that I just gave up on it.  Fortunately, I bought it at a warehouse club store and they took it back so I wasn't out the 70-some bucks.  Unfortunately, I won't get back the time I wasted on the whole nightmare.  Now, that's a good 5 or 6 hours of my life I'd like to have back!  I've reinstalled ECDC 5 for music and data CD's and I'll look for something else to do DVD's.Not this time!<br />  Reboot again.

Now, that's a good 5 or 6 hours of my life I'd like to have back!  I've reinstalled ECDC 5 for music and data CD's and I'll look for something else to do DVD's.	2004-03-24

Nevertheless, even some of the biggest names in removing spyware like McAfee and Norton's Systemworks programs, really don't actually do the job they are programed to. It does become a problem from time to time. Nevertheless, I tried to look at other options, but they just couldn't find ways to elimate adware that still sneaks into your computer, and clogs up your internet connections. When I stumbled on Intermute's SpySubtract Pro from the internet, I really looked like I hit the nail on the head, and I did find the right one.<br /><br />SpySubtract Pro, really is one of the hardest programs into filtering spyware,and adware based pop-up programs. The software is very simple, and really digs very deep into your computer to find even the toughest spyware big names like McAfee, Norton, and even Webroot's Spy Sweeper programs couldn't even take out. It really works very well at filtering out those parasites and makes your internet connection a whole lot faster and safer. I stumbled on a trial download from another one of Intermute's programs, AdSubtract Pro. The software even shows you all the internet websites trying to clog your web search including such spyware and adware sites like abetterintranet.com, shopathome.com, and many others that actually find ways to steal your identity. Thankfully, they can definitely be safeguarded away from here.<br /><br />While there are just so many that really say they do the job, Intermute really got it exactly right. The SpySubtract Pro is the only software you'll need against adware and spyware. This is one piece of software that I absolutely suggest for anybody.<br /><br />Quality: A<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Productivity: A+<br /><br />Overall: A	2005-02-13

So, the software functioned well: 1). imported last years TurboTax data; 2). imported Etrade, Schwab, and Fidelity transaction info completely and without errors; 3). WI and MI state filings completed without problems. 4). E-filed federa without problems; 5). printing and archiving worked fine.  I am a long-time TurboTax user who switched to HRB this year.  So far, the aforementioned programs are substantially equivalent in their functionality.  But, anyone who is trying to populate their Schedule D by importing transaction information from Etrade will likely be peeved.  Importing data from Fidelity and Schwab worked perfectly, that is, complete and with no errors.  However, I tried dozens of times to import tax data from Etrade using the HRB software. Up until 2-19-15, the HRB software returned the following error message: &#34;Your import was unsuccessful. Try again later or enter your tax information manually from your paper documents. Error code: 2000&#34;.  Of course, anyone with even a modest number of trades knows that entering such information by hand is not a solution.  The error code means, according to the HRB technical help team, that login credentials could not be verified.  HRB indicated that it is a known problem and that they are working on it.  On 2-20-15, I received a message from Etrade confirming that import failure is a known issue, and that they &#34;...received word from H&R Block that their software issue will be fixed no later than February 23rd.&#34;  Today's error message from HRB shifts the blame to Etrade: &#34;Your financial institution doesn't have your form ready to import yet. You can enter information from your paper form now or wait until your import is ready (on Tuesday, February 24, 2015).&#34;  Who's problem is it? Answer: yours.	2015-02-20

I knew I didn't want MS Money from an earlier try about 2 yrs ago.  Anyway, I use it for checkbook entries/family expense management and investments/portfolio management.  It converted everything from Q2002 without a hitch and I haven't had any problems.  Unlike some other problem areas, I do not use the bill pay portion of Quicken.  I can't download my bank transactions since they still use QIF, but I knew this ahead of time from all the Amazon reviews.  In order to get the same functions as Q2002 deluxe, I had to get the Premier Home and Business.

Something I didn't know until I read the reviews here at Amazon is that the software has a one year use, then you need to pay a fee. I gave that a lot of thought and decided that for the price, I'd go ahead and buy this since the price was appealing. I figure that as long as I do not install this it won't expire. The user's guide indicates that you do not need to register this until after about 14 uses, but I don't want to gamble on that to avoid the fee. I'll keep it in the event that I have an unsolvable problem with my machine. If it fixes the problem, I save the price and inconvenience of taking my machine to the shop. A couple weeks before I found this, I purchased two low price tools, \\"Ultimate Boot CD\\" and \\"Vista Repair/Recovery Disk\\". Why? They were inexpensive and might help solve a problem with my computer if I ever have one. Again, it might fix the problem without the need for professional fixes. One thing I definitely will not do is use any of the tools that do anything to my registry. I won't click on the clean and repair registry. Why? I've read numerous horror stories about what happens when you \\"mess around\\" with the registry unless you have knowledge of what you are doing. Several years ago, I downloaded a free registry cleaner from a trusted download site and when I tried to use it, my computer died. It would not start no matter what I did. I took it to the repair shop and they determined that Vista needed to be reinstalled. OK. I made a mistake and was willing to pay. The recovery disk that I received form Compaq when I purchased the machine was the wrong disk! My computer repairman called Compaq and they told him that since the computer wasn't under warranty, I would need to pay (about $70) for a download of the correct recovery software and a three day time limit. Plus, they would not guarantee that this would restore the machine! Woe is me! I ordered a OEM copy of Vista. Wrong decision! OEM software would not install! I borrowed a copy of Vista and had it installed using the OEM product key... Vista never did function as it should. A year later, I paid for a retail copy of Vista (Amazon) and had it installed... perfect! After that expensive and time consuming nightmare, I always advise friends to stay away from doing anything that disturbs the registry in their machine. That's my opinion. Back to System Suite 11, I haven't installed it so I cannot comment on it's usefulness, but I feel much more comfortable having it available in case my machine has problems. A very nice feature is the 300+ page User's Guide. Also, I would not install the antivirus software that is on the disk. I'm almost sure that it would expire after a year. One can install good free av software (AVG and Avast! are two I like).software and a three day time limit. Plus, they would not guarantee that this would restore the machine! Woe is me!

That is because Symantec/Norton leaves so much junk behind in uninstalling that it conflicts with itself, either slowing up or rendering the whole operating system unbootable.  When you try to get help from their technical support they blame it on a corrupted MicroSoft installer file and send you a half-dozen pieces of obfuscating, boilerplate \\"solutions\\" that will get anyone less than an expert to wind up with an unusable system.  Many people solve it either by re-formatting the drive--if they have a recent backup--or by using regedit to delete every Norton or Symantec entry of more than 500, selecting them one at a time.  And that still leaves files in half-dozen locations, many of which are \\"in use\\" and not deletable.  My guess is that this is their idea of copy protection or instant obsolescence.  But it doesn't end there:  Ironically, I got the program to update my old Quarterdeck Clean Sweep--what they call Clean Up--only to find after-the-fact that the program would not work with a modern dual cpu setup, though there was no mention of this in the System Requirements.  Ghost and GoBack also wouldn't work for me for who knows what reason and I already knew better than to trust their AV program.  Over the years I've watched Symantec buy and immediately screw up a host of excellent programs--MACE, DesqView, FastBack, Norton, Clean Sweep, and now Partition Magic and Drive/Ghost.  I've begun to suspect that Symantec isn't really a legitimate business but a corporate shell created to throttle and bury any good small independent firm's programs that competitively annoy the biggies. No firm can be this incompetent.	2005-02-22

There are not many online games that are suitable for her and that allow her to play the game at her pace.  Also, she now is quite familiar with 'buffering', the esc key due to the right click menu coming up, and at times she will accidently click on other links or close the IE window, making it a bit frustrating for both of us.  This game solves all of this.  The game fills the entire screen and it is not possible to switch to another program without hitting a very obvious stop button, which is great to me as my daughter does not end up where she does not want to be.  This game has a variety of little games, with a mini clip of the characters explaining what is going on, so it is fun to watch and play.  There are three levels of difficulty, and the easy one is just right for her.  The game also requires only the use of the mouse so she does not have to figure out the keyboard.  There are also little 'bonus' finds for her by clicking on each person, they will say different things, and if she wants to repeat the game, it will at a harder level.  Once I helped her thru the game the first time, she was off on her own.  She can play it and there is some challenges, but she is able to complete the game on her own which increases the level of fun.  The CD does need to be in the drive, which hasn't been a pain yet as I just leave it in, but at least that keeps extra stuff off of the computer.  When you do stop the game, either you have to let very long credits roll thru or kill the game. But this is not a big deal.  Also, the game is an 'older' game, but it runs fine on my machine with Vista on it, occassionally pausing when its reading from the CD.  There have not been any errors when running the game.  Both of us are quite pleased with it.	2012-10-02

You can press cancel when it asks for your email address to link your account if you don't want to link it.<br /><br />When upgrading it seems like QB should transfer and save the location of backups, registration information, etc. Especially when selecting the easy upgrade option, but alas, it does not, or at least not when I upgraded.<br /><br />There weren't really any big bugs in the process of upgrading QB and upgrading the company file. It is unfortunate that the upgrade process couldn't be more streamlined (meaning, don't ask us to upload our company files or link them and remember the settings for backups and such).<br /><br />-- Is what's new worth it? --<br /><br />One of the first things that you'll notice is that the user interface has received a face lift. It seems more flat and the colors are different. Is it better than previous versions? Not really. In fact, it might require some getting used to.<br /><br />The new navigation headers and side bars might be good for some users, but they just take up extra space that I'd rather have for actually doing work.<br /><br />For accounting software, it's not like they rewrite all the rules of accounting for the next release. The basics stay the same, and QB tries to put a new look on each new release or add a few new reporting tools. Can you get by without upgrading, probably. Is it nice to have the latest version, the version you know that they'll keep working on and focusing on stability? Yes. So, if you like to run the latest version then go ahead. Compared with previous upgrades a few years back that had stability problems, this one seems to run just fine after the upgrade.pared with previous upgrades a few years back that had stability problems, this one seems to run just fine after the upgrade.	2012-11-12

This Christmas gift has become a growing nightmare, involving an increasingly distressed child. All attempts to actually install the software have failed, and all attempts to find a way to actually talk to an Adobe support person who can help with installation have hit a brick wall.<br /><br />Calling customer service led me through a series of choices that finally culminated in a recorded message stating that FREE phone support was unavailable for Adobe Premiere Elements. It offered to let me pay money to talk to someone. Alternatively, I could pursue customer service &#34;live chat&#34; for free.<br /><br />There wasn't any way that I was going to pay them money because I got a product that wasn't working as it should. Pursuing the free option required creating an Adobe account. However, the &#34;create account&#34; link opened up a page in which one was to fill in a series of unmarked fields (I guess you just need to know what's supposed to go into each field). My son guessed--but then there was no &#34;submit&#34; button. Hitting &#34;return&#34; didn't do the trick. Hence, we found ourselves unable to create the account that we needed to get the help that we needed. We tried a different browser, to see if it was an interface issue, but the same problem arose.<br /><br />I looked for a way to contact Adobe, perhaps by e-mail, but all the &#34;contact us&#34; links on their website eventually channeled us back to the page to create an account--which still didn't work. So there proved to be no way to ask them about our original problem or to express concern over the inability to create an account.<br /><br />My son's disappointment is matched only by my anger. The take-home lesson is this: If you have any problems installing this product, Adobe has designed themselves to be unreachable for help...unless you pay them for the privilege. This is a terrible customer support model. If I buy a product that isn't working properly, I shouldn't have to pay the company more money for the pleasure of working through the inconvenience with them.<br /><br />The upshot: This product may be great. I have no idea, since I can't get it installed and can't get help from Adobe to install it. What I do know is that if you are not yourself expert in Adobe product troubleshooting, you should think twice about buying this product...and then decide not to.	2014-02-05

I have used it for 2 years so far on three different computers at the same time.  Also my company uses McAfee as their corporate standard for over 50,000 end users.  I believe it to be solid and it has consistently worked well for me.  My only problem has to do with the price... each year you have to pay again and each year the price goes up.  It is almost always cheaper to re-purchase the product than to extend the license.  Also, they give you 2GB of online storage for backups.  My wife exceeded that and the only way to get more is to pay $59/year for unlimited storage.  She only needs another couple GB of storage, and $60/year more is too much to ask for.  But they have me trapped because my wife does not want more programs on her laptop and she is not technical. So I have to pay the price... per year, every year.  So the bottom line is that this is a great product, but the cost will seem low at the beginning until you keep on paying more and more.  Smart business model for them, bad for me. Highly recommend though.	2011-10-14

I own almost every scrapbook software program out there and this is by far my favorite.  I wanted something that had cool pre-made pages that I could just drop my digital photos into.  This program has the most beautiful pre-designed pages that are all ready for you to personalize with your own titles and text!  You could literally have a gorgeous completed scrapbook page in a matter of minutes.  In addition, you can create incredible pages from scratch if you choose to, with all the great artwork and options contained in this program.<br />It has such great features -- you can even change the colors of the clipart to fit a certain color scheme you have in mind. That's a real rarity in scrapbooking programs that have pre-made template pages.  It also has the greatest paper doll cutouts that you can use on your pages.  You can create darling paper doll duplicates of any individual -- match their hair, eye and skin color, dress them up in the same clothes that are in the photos, give them things to hold that go along with the theme of the page, etc.<br />I can't say enough good things about this software.  If you are a novice, you will want to actually READ the manual or at least go through the on-screen tutorials.  If you've used similiar programs before, you'll probably be able to just install and start designing.<br />I did read one helpful hint that I'm very happy I know about on a Sierra help page.  It deals with how to insert digital photos into a template.  I thought I'd post it here so that someone who gets this great software doesn't get frustrated like some of the people who've posted reviews have gotten.<br />When you want to insert a digital picture into a pre-set frame or object, click inside the white space of the frame so that it selects this area. Right click and choose &quot;Replace Picture&quot; and the Graphics Grabber window opens. In the Graphics Grabber window select the &quot;Import button&quot;. Select an image on your computer and choose the Import button. At this point it adds the image to the Graphics Grabber window. Double click on the image in the Graphics Grabber window, and it will replace the white space with your picture.  Resize it if necessary, and you're done in a snap!  I think that understanding how to insert pictures correctly was probably the main trouble people were having with using this program.<br />It sounds like this software has been a little hard for some people to figure out, but I thought it was pretty easy.  And even if it does seem confusing or something at first, trust me, it's worth the effort to learn how to use it.  THIS SCRAPBOOKING SOFTWARE IS THE GREATEST!

I wanted this as I am a long time artist and wanted to produce new music with Logic Express. After installation, I listened to many of the instruments and loops. In my opinion, if you are a total professional and are scoring for the major movies that get made and released, you probably want to spend the $1000's of dollars for the totally professional products out there. If you're not that particular person, which how many people like that are out there really, the Apple Jam packs are the best. You get the best value and sounds for the genre that you can get. I can't emphasize enough what it's like to listen to world music sounds from different parts of the world, that you can use in your own music, that are totally excellent and usable. Cuban instruments are an example, as well as the African ones. You can't get more authentic. Consider how much it would cost to bring these musicians or producers together to produce these sounds for you. And they ain't no tweenky sounds tweaked from a synthesizer that sort of reminds you of the real thing, or a midi file joke. It's the real stuff. Thanks again to Steve Jobs and Apple.	2007-06-22

I never could get it to work to what was offered as its full potential. It took me a week to get the smallest file edited. It was a major issue to do the smallest task. It was difficult to edit a pdf file, the program locked up on all three of my computers. And you have to upgrade nearly every year to keep it working properly - no small fee at nearly $200.00 a pop.     I had a book I needed to work on and had to get it out fast. So in desperation, I purchased Foxit. In less than five hours, I had the entire book edited - images were added easily, text could be moved and shifted and added. It was so simple, I didn't even need to use the directions. However, you can get them online. They are simple and concise. I highly recommned this program to anyone thinking about going to the other pdf document editors. It is inexpensive and the customer support is awesome. (I called to find out the difference between their different programs). There are also free trials on their site. Try it there first. This is for someone who hates, hates, hates to have to read an entire book to figure out a program. It was up and running in minutes.	2011-04-03

In my 10 or so attempts, I've seen the update feature complete successfully only once. At other times the update feature ended up hanging while checking for updates or after completing the downloads, or simply reported a failure to install packages. This is over a DSL connection with plenty bandwidth. <br /> <br />The application at times behaves erratically, with the control center showing up slow, only partially, or not at all. Sometimes a reboot helps, sometimes it doesn't. As a separate issue, attempts to delete messages using my yahoo web mail account with the firewall enabled have failed. <br /> <br />Of the packages that I have tried recently (McAfee, Norton, CA) this has been the worst installation experience. It seems to be working now, but my level of confidence in this product is low. <br />	2006-11-25

Because, while I'm not about to go looking under the hood and I can't see where the mechanics published any new exciting information about modifications to the engine, all I see are some rather inconsequential cosmetic changes to the user interface like the banner on the home screen now appearing as white rather than black ,Insight being relegated to a sub-menu,a link to download a power eraser tool if all else fails and  something about a cloud there's no way I'll ever use. So, if you were satisfied with the performance of the 2013 version of this security suite, nothing about this version should cause any concern (...well, other than installing it which we'll get to in a moment). If the interest is a first time install or a revisit to the Norton family, I am going to reiterate much of last year's review, because for the typical home user, I still believe this security alternative is among the most comprehensive and easiest to use packages presently available whether the need is for one PC or multiples.<br /><br />However, as far as installation is concerned, there is unquestionably room for improvement. With the de-emphasis of internal optical drives, many software developers are moving toward downloadable products. Norton 360 still has a physical CD available but the recommended option is download from the Norton site, so naturally my choice is to install from the CD which is supposed to upgrade the existing version...yeah, right or more accurately.. yeah, but not without encumbrances like a conflict between two versions that is not resolvable without a hard restart. My suggestion would be to delete the old version and do a fresh install if the decision is to go with CD install. It might mean loss of histories, existing network mapping and resetting preferences but it might also be less of a headache than trying to transfer them via the supposed upgrade capability. From my second PC, I did go the online route and it worked without incident.<br /><br />That said, and feeding into my unabashedly admitted laziness, the following is an excerpt from last year's review, and as I am a fan of the 360 product, probably a preview of my review of next year's version:<br /><br />Norton 360 is a comprehensive security suite with an array of processes and tasks consolidated in a single application. The complement of features can be found in the manufacturer's description above. Each of the features could be addressed through other resources and admittedly, a few of them might well be more effectively administered by standalone apps, but for the user who wants to set it and forget it, this product is among the top choices.<br /><br />For less knowledgeable users, who may desire to find out more about security protocols and firewall settings, there are support functions here that can assist and increase awareness of threats they may not have even known they could monitor, of particular interest if surfing curiosity takes the user to a wide range of unknown sites.  I know with dynamic IP assignment, 360 is a fast and convenient way to identify physical addresses for all of the devices I have on my network with logging on the router.  Backup to external drives or online to the Norton storage site is also supported. In fact, the only difference between the standard and Premium additions of this suite is the amount of basic online storage available, with the standard addition providing 2GB and the Premium 25GB. Users, however, with multi-device platforms including Macs and mobile devices would be better served by purchasing the Multi-device version of this software.<br /><br />I am rather obsessive about running registry cleanup and 360 offers another utility to supplement the shareware app I use most regularly. I do so because I do think any one product successfully identifies all files that could be cleaned. Similarly, Startup manager is another utility that can be assessed elsewhere but is another convenience found in this product and scanning performance can be improved by adjustments available with Norton Insight.ing performance can be improved by adjustments available with Norton Insight.	2013-11-03

Customer service like that you are likely to receive from Parallels will eventually break them.     Apparently there are a few bugs related to networking on Windows XP and/or Vista. It's hard to say exactly what's involved, but I can say that for weeks I could not get either one to connect to my wireless network. I wrote to Parallels and received no help. In fact one email asked me to send them configuration information that was in the email that they were replying to. I also filed an even more formal help request through the software help menu and that received no reply. Only after searching for hours on the internet was I able to find Unix code that could be entered into the terminal that solved the problem. I have to wonder how in the world any of their less savvy customers ever would have found that solution.    There are better VM solutions out there and I strongly recommend going with a product other than Parallels.	2008-11-12

I had no problem installing this version on my Windows 7 computer.  Then I strugled for days trying to figure out what Hallmark had done with what has been a great card program for years.  As usual they have not added a whole lot of new cards, but that seems to be normal for them.  I quickly found out there are several features they have dropped.  One being the border function which allowed one to choose a line border, for example, and then adjust the width and margin of that border on a card as well as choose a color.  That function is now gone and customer service suggests using borders listed in the frames and border listing in clip art.  Not the same as in the past, and you are limited in using those borders.    Another change they made is to drop the function of using arrows on the right side of the screen when changing one of their program cards or while making a card using art studio.  Those arrows allowed the user to move on object or text up or down, and also to easily change the width or height of the project open.  Now you have to use your mouse to drag the tabs of the open box to resize it.  Just not the same and makes it more difficult to use.  They've also made it harder to change font type and size.    They have created a mess in trying to use the software for printing envelopes or labels.  Once a label is open, for example, you then have to click on text and select what you want to show on the label from the a/b tab (address book).  If you select name and address then you have to click add to move it to the right column.  After you click OK, you then have to use your mouse on the tabs to enlarge the open box.  Otherwise the full name and address will not print.  Once you click on print, and then click the address book tab on the lower left, the major fault becomes apparent.  The address book listing of names is not in alphabetical order.  You have to scan the list of names from top to bottom searching for the name you want to print, then put a checkin the box.  Then the printing function is as it was - show which row and column to print in and it's OK after that.    I've been in contact with Hallmark customer service by email about these problems.  Does not look like the border function will be fixed or changed.  Same with the arrows to adjust the open box while making a card.  They do acknowledge, however, that the address book names not being listed in alphabetical order is an error on the part of their programmers.  I've asked if it will be fixed with a patch or if I have to wait for the 2012 version and do not have an answer.  Obviously they do not test these programs fully before putting them out for sale.  BAD!    A couple years ago Hallmark put out a version of the same program which printed all cards off center.  I made phone calls and sent emails to no avail.  Adding new features to this great software is OK, but removing things that users are used to is unacceptable.  Each new program Hallmark puts out should contain many more new cards then they now add.  I'm not sure they care anymore.     I still have the 2010 version on my computer and there is no conflict.  I find my self reverting mostly to the 2010 version so I wasted money on buying the new one.	2010-12-19

It also allows you to carry multiple files on SD cards or USB drive or even your tablet.<br />This version of WinZip connects directly to Dropbox, Google Drive etc so you can use it to organize all your cloud files at once. A password can be set for encrypted files for security.<br /><br />It also converts files to PDF, a useful feature for me, I have been using the free PrimoPDF so far. It can also create a read only PDF that is useful for things like resumes.

EACH software has unbeatable features and tools that help you produce endless possibilities!<br /><br />It is an unbeatable price for so many different softwares to be sold as a single suite bundle. If you priced out the different prices for the products individually, they would each be nearly as much as the Creative Suite by itself.<br /><br />I give this software a 5 star rating because this product deserves it!	2014-05-31

First, this is only virus protection; it will not protect against spyware.  You need Norton Systemworks or 360 if you really want to use Norton products for full protection (And I think poorly of them).  Granted you can use this product and purchase spyware protection such as Webroot or Ad-Aware pro (the free version of Ad-Aware requires you to download updates and start the scan yourself).  But if you really want to mix packages there better virus protection packages out there.    I define \\"better virus protection\\" as either:  1)  As good of protection but much cheaper.  2)  Better protection at a somewhat lower price.  3)  More likely to work on your computer (notice that 100% of security software gives some computers problems).    Since Norton is as expensive as it gets and is the least like to work (in my opinion from using it on our systems at work and home use), the only reason to purchase it is that it is not the absolute worst out there.  That is not a good reason.	2008-02-24

(System: XP-Pro, SP-3) I installed the 2010 trial download, and in the process of initialization, it stopped and gave me an error message about how it could not initialize.  OK, I tried it several more times, once even with a fresh download.  Same thing each time. OK, so I'm not about to trust my BACKUPS to a program that will not even work in the trial version, so I go into Control Panel \\"Add and Remove Programs\\" and there's no Acronis listed.  So good, I think, maybe this creepy thing has not yet even gotten into the Registry and I can simply delete the folder full of junk that had already been installed.  But first, I went on some forum boards and learned that deleting the folder was not an option because even at the stage at which the install failed, it had already messed with my Registry files.<br /><br />One week and six emails to Acronis later and I still have this toxic mess on my computer and no way to get rid of it.  I have not received so much as an autoresponder acknowledgment from Acronis. From this day forward, I will NEVER install a program until I know for certain that there is an uninstall utility included with it.  Acronis has no uninstall, and according to the forum posts I've been reading, there are some intensely complex procedures one can use to uninstall most of the damage, but even with them, you can't be sure.<br /><br />Way to go, Acronis.<br /><br />BTW, I downloaded the free, well-reviewed Macrium Reflect and it works perfectly.  A few simple clicks on the clean and intuitive interface and I had the full HD image that I was after in the first place. Too bad that image also contains the Acronis damage. I can only hope there will be no conflicts between Macrium and the Acronis that is still on my computer.  So far, so good.	2009-11-23

I settled on iBank 4 for what appeared to be the best of all the bad options available for Mac.  All in all, iBank has proven frustrating to use on a daily basis compared to the fluid work flow from Quicken.  It's just the myriad of little design quirks and software bugs that when taken together make up for a crappy experience.  1) Categories are not listed until you type a letter, 2) Few keyboard shortcuts, 3) crappy import experience from Quicken PC with lots of manual labor, 4) Software bug creates transaction templates even when told not do so, 5) Report customization is a far cry from anything decent, 6) Scheduled transactions cannot be bypassed when due, you are forced to deal with them when program starts, 7) etc, etc.  Customer support has been unresponsive and indifferent.  They appear to have a marketing strategy to keep customers barely functioning, while struggling with bugs, so they can force customers into buying the next version that *may* finally solve the problems. Repeat the process.  I will not endorse Quicken products either. They behavior toward the Mac community and sun-setting policies for software are just as bad.	2011-11-02

When I boot up, my CPU load was pretty light as shown by the norton performance check. Also, it doesnt seem to have any memory leakage. The scans are lightening fast and the reports option seems never ending.  I really like the graphic depiction of whats going on so you know its not frozen. My favorite feature is how this program tracks everything that is going on when your computer is in use and when idle. It also gives a historical graph showing what programs were running and what was eating up the CPU, similar to basice windows 7 features. If Norton keeps this up, they have brought back a loyal buyer as long as they do a good job with virus counter efforts and keep them up to date.. I had registered the free preview in less than a week I was so impressed. This product came pre-installed for 30 days on my new Toshiba laptop. I'd given up on the memory hog Norton in the past so I was prepared to remove the program and install Trend Micro. After about 10 days on my laptop, I noticed I couldn't tell that Norton was running. The mystery is solved in that it just quietly runs in the background.	2010-09-14

The campaign is fun and the A.I. is noticeably improved from the original, but it still makes mistakes and poor decisions. Late game I've found that I spend a lot more time managing my provinces and armies then I do actually fighting. This becomes somewhat tedious. Also, I have found that my armies often end up looking the same a few samurai and spear men and a lot of archers. As the army grows I often add stronger units and possibly some horsemen for harassment but the overall make up stays the same.     STEAM sucks and having to connect through it and being subject to its adds bothers me.     Multilayer can be fun but starting out be prepared to lose often. The majority of time you fight level 10 generals who have better skills, more of them and upgraded units. Multilayer does add some diversity to the game. Compared to the campaign there seems to be a lot more diversity in the make up of armies you face and provides a number of difficult opponents to fight.	2011-08-08

I use Windows NT, 95, and 98 in varying work and leisure activities and find there are definite advantages to having 98 available when it comes to adding and configuring certain devices, especially USB and certain 3D  cards.  If you're a gamer and want to keep playing the leading 3D games,  Windows 2000 won't treat you any better than Windows NT. Of course there  are exceptions.  Like Quake II in Open GL with my Voodoo Banshee. But for  most popular games you will still need Windows 98.  Upgrading from Windows  95 to Windows 2000 and expecting to be able to use all the same software on  your system, is like expecting the same thing out of Windows NT 4. That's  because Windows 2000 IS Windows NT.  Remember, it WAS called WIndows NT  5.0.  <br />Windows 98 makes it easier to operate in today's market with the  newer software and devices that are becoming available.  Remember, if the  system requirements on that software you are buying don't state that it  will work on NT, it probably won't work on Windows 2000 either.	1999-11-22

I can't rate the product or the company with any other grade that \\"Poor\\" because the customer is forced to upgrade whenever Intuit says you must. I was using Quickbooks 2006 with Intuit's merchant account very successfully, and I was told by Intuit that if I didn't buy the 2009 version, my version of Quickbooks would no longer work with my merchant account. I would only be able to do stand alone credit card transactions. I would then have to manually update my Quickbooks software with the transaction. This is not the first time they have forced customers to upgrade.     If only someone would write some good small business accounting software to compete with Intuit. I would be their first customer.    As far as the 2009 version goes, there are no upgrades in it which are substantial enough to warrant the price that it costs.    Shame on you, Intuit!	2009-04-12

The fact that 3D Home Architect v.5.0 is not compatible with 3D Home Architect v.4.0 drawings is the single worst upgrade mistake you could make - and I paid the price (see Broderbund: Technical Note ID: 31665). Who's bright idea was that? Find them and tell them they should sell shoes - not technology products. You can give them my name and I'll be glad to them directly. Broderbund should know better. Even if the formats are different they should have created a migration tool. No excuses - they should have. The fact that I now must REDRAW all my work in order to take advantage of 5.0 features is insane.  For their protection, other potential Broderbund customers should know about this total lack of customer support perpetrated by their company. Too bad. I really thought Broderbund had it together.	2002-10-15

I have never been a fan of &quot;lite&quot; products. Photo Deluxe was, in my opinion, a poor excuse for image editing software. I was afraid this was just going to be Photo Deluxe 2. I was wrong. Elements has the tools that the amateur/hobbyist needs. I'd even venture to guess that most web developers could get by with this as well. Those familiar with Adobe's pro version of Photoshop will likely not miss a thing. In addition, I've found it to be much faster that Paint Shop Pro 7. I run a 950 Mhz AMD Athlon, and PSP just feels sluggish. Elements is very responsive.<br />I won't go into all the features that I think make it an excellent buy, but the one that stands out is the photomerge. It allows you to take several individual photos having overlap and stitch them into a panorama. I had some photos like this that I took years ago on a trip, and I seriously doubted the software would be able to stitch them together. It worked flawlessly with no tweaking or fooling around. In about 1 minute they were seamlessly merged. <br />In addition to this, I've found it very easy to use. I've been fooling around with the pro version of Photoshop for several years, and I never knew how to use 30%+ of the features. Elements guides you through without insulting your intelligence. <br />If you're joining the digital photography masses with the purchase of a scanner and/or a digital camera, this is a &quot;must own&quot; piece of software. Forget Paint Shop Pro or the junky stuff that came with your imaging device and just buy this. It's easy to see why the pros have been such big Adobe fans all these years.	2001-07-15

Software	1	1	1	N	Y	If I could rate it lower, I would.	Let me start off by saying that I am fairly technologically savvy. This product was by far the worst purchase I've made in the last 5 years.<br /><br />The program records keystrokes, but once you shut down your computer or log off the user account, all keystrokes disappear. Thats right, gone. So, I have a need to record keystrokes on my computer, install this program, can view keystrokes from the current session, but cannot retrieve it later.<br /><br />So, to fix the problem, I contact the company. I get a barely literate non-english speaking tech that tells me to increase the rate that the program captures screenshots. Which is useless advice by the way. I really didn't care about screen shots, I cared about logging keystrokes and seeing what was being typed into my computer. I told the manufacturer that they didn't fix my problem and I was told to, you guessed it, increase the rate of caputuring screen shots.<br /><br />So, I increased the rate of caputuring screen shots. Which did nothing to give me keystroke data. So I asked for a refund. The company, not amazon, has to approve a refund, which they failed to do.<br /><br />If you are considering this product, I highly highly recommend not buying it.<br /><br />BAD PRODUCT, SHODDY TECH SUPPORT, AND SHADY REFUND PRACTICES. SAVE 30 BUCKS AND BUY LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE. SERIOUSLY, IF YOU TOOK 30 AMERICAN DOLLARS AND LIT THEM ON FIRE, IT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT.	2012-12-10

Linspire comments out or limits package repositories - which is essentially trying to make you use their way of doing things - and make an educated decision before purchase. If you want the easiest possible transition from Windows to Linux and don't mind the restraints - go Linspire.<br /><br />More Details:<br /><br />PRO's:<br />If you're a beginner to Linux - don't know much about Operating Systems - and don't plan on learning a whole lot about them - then Linspire is probably your best choice. It offers the stability and security of a Linux system with the familiar Windows atmosphere. Install is easy and getting around will be as well. You can find a lot of software in their Click-N-Run database and program install is painless. If your familiar with Linux or OS's  - or you are willing to learn and you will work around the restraints in Linspire - then go for it! BUT...<br /><br />CON's:<br />If you want to learn Linux, tweak the system and enjoy the freedom that is open source OS - then you should check out Ubuntu or SUSE. Both of those are free for download and install (SUSE will even mail you an install CD!). Linspire charges ~$50 for their OS and they keep on charging for all kinds of things. The aformentioned CNR (Click-N-Run) has a lot of the programs which you pay for that are free otherwise! So you pay for a Linux OS (rather than use a free one) then you pay to install programs (rather than download and install the free one yourself). The aim here, other than funding, is to provide people with the easiest means of Linux. The downfall is that you are restrained and seem to pay for things that you could get for free. Slip a DVD into the drive and if you don't have Linspire's commercial DVD player installed - a window opens up and informs you that you'll have to pay Linspire to play DVDs. You'll also notice that every time you put in an application program CD, you get a similar pop-up from Linspire reminding you that you could be paying them money instead of doing things your own way.<br /><br />I realize the world runs off currency, but I also realize that there's an alternate means to a more stable OS than Windows without a Click-N-Pay backbone. Go Linux! Less intrusive, more stable and secure, more freedom! Choose your distro!<br /><br />Sidenote: If you get Linspire, you can alter it to be less restrained - as lucidly pointed out by Jem Matzan.ad and install the free one yourself).

Here's hoping they don't break it or something else again -lol. (Fingers crossed)    Previous Review >Now, I can appreciate the effort Intuit goes through to improve their QB products and 2015 looks like a nice set of refinements and features. But there's one thing that has stopped me in my tracks from upgrading. Time Sheets lost the ability to sort by Customer:Job after the R3 update to QB 2014.    The worst decision an Intuit Quickbooks product manager has ever made was the change made in QB 2014 R3. When viewing a previously saved weekly timesheet, the time entries will remain in the \\"order in which they were originally entered\\" rather than sorted A-Z by Customer:Job.    Why in the world would they make a change like this with out leaving a way to have time sheets function the way they have for 10+ years? This alone may be the reason that I NEVER buy another QB release. And by the way, they tried this for a brief moment with QB2013 R7 and quickly reverted after bad feedback. Really seems like a simple fix - just make the columns sortable by just clicking the column heading like in databases.	2014-10-26

When I look at the positive reviews of this software I have to wonder who has written them. I bought this software recently and it is extremely disappointing. In fact I have not seen software so poorly designed and implemented for many years. It has poor and inconsistent functionality and is buggy. The funny thing with software is that a good product just does the job and you really don't notice it. With SmartDraw there are so many situations that behave unexpectedly, inconsistently and erroneously that the software is always in the way of what you are trying to achieve.  Even with my first experiences of drawing a simple floor plan layout I managed to get the software in a infinite redraw loop and could not proceed. This is with the 2010 fully patched edition (March 2010). I used Visio for years - it wasn't perfect, but now I appreciate it a lot more. SmartDraw makes great play of a few features to link objects together, which sounds good. However, it has neglectd the basics. It isn't robust, it isn't consistent and it lacks design. There are a few bells and whistles but no substance. Oh and there's lots of marketing!

I was very excited to get the newest version; Excel's added size was my biggest seller.  However, after buying this version, I hate it, absolutely hate it.  The menus are all gone, now it's a Ribbon.  I build custom Excel and Access programs, with custom menus.  You can no longer change the menus, all custom items are added to the Add Ins tab.  Finding simple age old functions is next to impossible.  I've had to use the Help feature so much just to figure out how to do the simplest things and where they are now located.  I do miss the Office Assistant as well.  Many will say it was a waste of space, but I personally enjoyed it.  All the new file types are not backwards compatible.  I can't create any file and then take it to my work computer and open it with 2003.  All my old files (pre 2007) act funny when opened with 2007.  For example, Excel creates shadow like images of my data and starts putting it all over the spreadsheet.  But if you do an Alt + Tab it clears for about 5 min and then starts all over again.  I've had nothing but trouble with this software.  This is by far worse than Office 97 ever was and I hated it.  Access is missing features I was very used to in 2003.  Certain things can only be done in VB now.  Word's Mail Merge took me 3 hours to finally get it to import my list for labels.  Using 2003, it was done in 3 min.  If you want a good office suite, buy 2003, stay away from this garbage.  I've since uninstalled 2007 completely and went back to 2003.	2007-10-27

I want to start of by saying do not buy this product with the idea that it alone is all you need to become fluent. Levels 1-3 will give you a good foundation in the language and probably some fairly good speaking skills - but you will still have a ways to go. Also, sadly, you will not have developed very much conversational skills after this first level. You will learn some \\"need-to-know\\" stuff, yes, but stuff that you will most likely not use very much. There are sentences like \\"The cat is in the hat\\" and \\"The keys are in the shoe\\". I understand the reasoning behind forming sentences like this (prepositions and the prepositional case), but you would think that more focus would be paid on actual conversational skills.<br />Another gripe is that the images are not unique to the language. You would think that if you pay over $200 bucks for one level (and over $500 for all three) that you would be getting something unique. Having said that, there is a wide range of different Russian speakers throughout level one - all very pleasant and easy to understand.<br />The online features are absolutely great. This is one reason why it's earned four stars from me. I honestly think Rosetta Stone could really make some money if they separated the software and their online stuff.<br /><br />So, to sum everything up: this is a good, addictive, and interactive product; but it definitely shouldn't be your only resource. Buy some books to understand some of the grammar, and try to get yourself a dictionary or always have Google Translate handy and ready to go. Also, try to hook up with some native speakers via Skype or something, especially if you want to learn some real conversational skills. You can probably learn more in a few hours with a native speaker (when it comes to day-to-day conversations) than Rosetta Stone Russian level 1 will teach you.	2011-02-12

I am a user, of course, and can only report my experiences. If you are more concerned about one area over another, say malware vs viruses, then I refer you to professional testers who dig deeper.   I CAN answer to the usability of the product which underwent a MAJOR overhaul with the 2009 version. This new 2010 version maintains the improvements of the previous version. Major sticking points of this program have all been addressed since 2009:   1. Norton Internet Security now has virtually no impact on system resources. It will not slow down your machine.  2. It picks up new threat definitions every few minutes so your machine is more up to date.  3. It can be as complicated or uncomplicated as you want it to be. I have left it at mostly default settings and it does its job silently with almost no interference or interruptions of my work.  Why one star shy of perfect? It is a SECURITY application. NO security app is perfect and the missing star is a reminder of that and to use good computing habits: know what you are clicking on, and enter your Web site addresses into the BROWSER address box, NOT your search engine.  I use this on an XP and Vista machine.  If you are considering an antivirus, this has it PLUS the watchful eye over Internet connections and activities PLUS it is a THREE computer license. It is a good buy.  TIP FOR THOSE WITH AN OLDER VERSION WITH SUBSCRIPTION TIME LEFT LOOKING TO UPGRADE TO 2010: If you have a previous version of this software and install the new disk over it, you WILL END any remaining time on your current subscription as opposed to extending it. Norton allows you to upgrade from one version of this program to the latest for FREE as long as you have time remaining on your subscription. Use their upgrade center online first to upgrade from version 2009 to 2010. THEN purchase the disk as an inexpensive way to extend your existing subscription. When the disk arrives open your existing copy of Norton Internet Security 2010 on your computer and click on the express renewal button in the lower right hand corner. Follow the instructions and just enter your new key from the disk that just arrived. This is actually an advantage to the software as you stay up to date all the time while you have the good alternative to extend the subscription CHEAPLY away from the software company.	2009-12-05

Although it's well known Symantec makes reliable softwares, When we talk about their rebates, they are liars. Yes, liars ¨Cthey really deserve this. Based on my personal experience, I even think theirs are worse than the notorious I/O Magic's (aka, Hi-Val, Digital research). I bought several Norton softwares during last December, and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items, Guess what, until today I got only one of them, and it has been almost 6 months. I guess they are testing my memory but unfortunately I kept a good record of every rebate I submitted. That's what we should do if we are going to buy Symantec softwares with rebates involved, although the best thing I would recommend is to avoid as long as you can.	2003-05-16

Be aware that the PC Keycard version does not offer any way to download an installer and manage installations as you'd normally expect.  You start by going to a Microsoft site, and typing the software key into a webpage.  In the next step you have to enter your Microsoft account information (Hotmail, MSN, Skype, or a Windows 8 online account.)  The website then gives you a very small .exe file with the software key hard-coded into it.  This .exe file initializes installation from the internet.  You cannot re-use this small installer on other computers, because it's bound to the account and software key you entered on the website.  (Yes, even if you legally have multiple licenses, you still have to re-generate the installer for each individual one.)  From what I read, one Microsoft account can only be used to manage up to five licenses.  (I haven't hit this cap yet, but save yourself a headache and do some homework.)<br /><br />If you need to manage any more than a single copy, save yourself the headache and get the version that includes install media.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I've discovered that Microsoft does offer an option to download an ISO of this application.  After registering the key to your Microsoft Web Account, go to the product and find the \\"Install from a disc\\" link.  Next choose \\"I want to burn a disc\\" and you'll be able to download the ISO.  Even when installing from the ISO files, I repeatedly ran into an issue where the installer would suddenly quit, leaving a few changes on the machine.  Once this happens, the installer will no longer run at all, so you must download the Fix It from Microsoft that forcibly uninstalls Office 2013.  From this point, you can run the installer and get a working installation.<br /><br />I mentioned above the chance that MS limited the number of times you can register licenses to a single Microsoft account.  So far I've done 9 installations under a single account, and have yet to hit this limit.<br /><br />I'm pleased enough with the usability and interface of Office 2013, so I'm bumping this from one star to two, but the installation and registration headaches are unreasonable.account, and have yet to hit this limit.<br /><br />I'm pleased enough with the usability and interface of Office 2013, so I'm bumping this from one star to two, but the installation and registration headaches are unreasonable.	2013-04-12

I had Windows 7 installed professionally by Geek Squad on two Vista machines ($40 each).  I spent $150 on the software.  That means $230 down the drain and many hours and days of frustration.       The issues are unbelievable.  The most pressing issue was that Internet activity constantly hung up.  I cannot tell you the number of times I had to restart.  Every \\"program not responding\\" required a restart.     I spent hours, actually days, trying to figure out why I was always getting \\"program not responding\\".  I performed a lot of interet searches on on my XP machine on the problem.  The best answer I could find is that IE8 and Windows 7 have major issues. I thought maybe I could get rid of IE8 and return to IE7.  IE8 comes with Windows 7 and is automatically installed.  IE8 is not listed as a program that can be uninstalled.  In other words, you are stuck with IE8 when Windows 7 is installed because you cannot uninstall IE8.    The 'program not responding\\" issue is widely complained about on blogs and forums.  No one has a fix.  What is more disturbing is that you cannot go back to Vista after the Windows 7 install.      I just completed a 'factory recovery' re-install of one of my computers.  That's right I am back to square one with my laptop computer.  Today, I am going to work on trying to get my desktop computer back to the original factory Vista.  As much as I was unhappy with Vista, at least it is operational whereas the Windows 7 is not Internet ready.	2009-11-06

It says: 'Create, resize, merge, and convert partitions without destroying your data'. That claim is false. I had tried to partition one 4GB harddrive and it failed. I lost everything on the HD. They recommend doing a backup first. If I had the possibility to do a backup then I would not need this product, right? I could use fdisk instead! Way cheaper. Plus after 6 months this product becomes obsolete, they will not support it anymore, if you want support you need to upgrade.<br />The customer support sucks, I filled out a form on the website, after a week nothing. I called, I talked to a support specialist, he asked me to send some file. I sent the file. I waited another week or so. I called again, they did nothing. Into the end after staying on the phone for about 45 mins the person suggested that it was my fault. Of course it is my fault! It's my fault because I bought the product! Plus they do not have a toll free number, you pay for the call. The holding time is quite long which makes you think: if they have such a great product, why the wait? Because their product has flaws, that's why!<br />My recomandations:<BR>1. If you really, really need PM look for an older version that you can find used. It is not worth paying the price for just one job.<br />2. If you want to install Linux (like I wanted) better buy an extra haddrive of 4GB instead. It will cost you less, you won't have to go through all the hassles of backing up, calling customer support, waiting weeks until they bother to respond.	2002-02-05

X7 represents a substantial upgrade.<br /><br />I'm running the software on a machine I built that has an AMD FX-8320 processor.  That's an eight-core processor with 64-bit capability that runs at 3.5 ghz.  I've got it paired with 8gb of low latency Crucial memory and a Sapphire R9 270x video card with 2gb of video memory.  The program resides on an SSD.<br /><br />X7 launches almost instantly, and, even with large files, it runs smooth as silk on this setup.<br /><br />Corel actively supports this software.  On June 16, Corel released the X7.1 update, which is downloadable from their website for free.  (You have to have started at least a standard Corel account.  X7 requires that you start at least a free standard account in order to use templates and receive certain other benefits.  You can upgrade to a premium account, but that costs extra.)  I'm still toying around with this new X7.1 update.  In addition to general stability fixes, the main features it adds are the ability to customize elements of user interface (e.g., colors of borders and dialog boxes, location of status bar) and enhancements for the Object Model that make it more powerful.<br /><br />Workflow in the product is good, flexible, and intuitive.  Others have addressed that thoroughly and I don't have much to add there.<br /><br />You get a suite of programs that let you work well with vector graphics and with photo manipulation.  You also get a large number of high quality fonts with X7, almost all from the Bitstream type foundry, which has been around for decades producing excellent fonts.  If you were to buy the fonts separately, the cost would easily surpass the entire price of this package.<br /><br />Overall, I have found this to be a great upgrade.  The 64-bit core allows the program and computer to exploit full memory resources and gives a great boost to stability and speed in my experience.<br /><br />This is a powerful tool for graphic design and isn't too daunting to learn to use.  Highly recommended.	2014-06-19

It was very  slow and crashed from time to time. I did like it's features, though. I was  able to customize scans and got good copies. Textbridge worked OK with b  &amp; w typed material but made lots of errors with color magazine articles  and took ages to correct.<br />Since upgrading to IE5.5 I haven't gotten Pagis  to work. Scansoft's patch and technical support haven't solved the problem  either.<br />Overall, a good program (when it works), but buggy.	2000-08-28

The program itself is 3 years old and it's obvious the creators had not anticipated System 2.6 and above. Contacted eMedia and they concluded the disc, Version 1.0  was bad. Version 1.0 is three years old, which indicates how long the product may have been sitting on Amazon stock shelves, but maybe not. The eMedia folks immediately sent me a new one. Just tried it out, and it doesn't work either, exhibiting same symptoms of the same script error. Did some research and found out that a later version of the program does exist for newer Macs called Version 1.0.1, but this has to be downloaded from the Apple Store. Product may work fine on PC machines, but be careful with newer Macs. Like most digital products these days, it is one disc in an oversized box with no real documentation. The diagnostic program to troubleshoot problems can be downloaded from the eMedia website, but it doesn't work either  because the diagnostic program presumes there is a Serial No. for the product. Emedia said there is no serial no. I have not even contact Amazon yet.	2013-02-04

I read a review about Simply Accounting 2003 and it was rated #1 in features and ease of use, and of course the best value on the market.  The parent company Accpac is one of the largest big business accounting software companies and they brought a lot of features to the small business user.  The review was so good I decided to try it for the price figuring I did not have anything to lose.  It converted my records with ease, and I have to agree, this software is better than Quickbooks, by far.  I can't believe they sell it at such a low price.  It has to be they are trying to get themselves recognized and established against Quickbooks --- but I have to admit that the low price initiall scared me off fiquring it must not be as robust as Quickbooks since it is only about 20% of the cost of Quickbooks.	2003-12-24

The emphasis was not on speaking, but rather to give us the basic tools in order to begin the process of deciphering German texts.  I've had a few other language classes since then, establishing me if not as a thorough polyglot at least as a someone well versed in language training from a variety of different teaching styles, approaches, and contexts.<br /><br />I've tried to keep up with a number of these languages I've studied, with various success, and with various software help. Mostly the inexpensive kind.  I've picked up the Instant Immersion disks (a great, inexpensive, entirely un-thorough approach), the Learn to Speak series (about the same, though with a lot more content).<br /><br />Recently, to learn German for my studies I looked at more thorough programs and two stood out.  The Rosetta Stone series and the Tell Me More.  I noticed Tell Me More was getting great reviews and was less than half the price.  Being a little financially strapped I skipped the trend and bought Tell Me More. And I'm very glad I did. It's an effective program that has pushed me quite along in learning the language.<br /><br />Still, there was a tickle in my brain.  Is Rosetta Stone really better?<br /><br />Now, with Rosetta Stone German and Tell Me More German in hand I have an answer.<br /><br />And yes, Rosetta Stone is the better program.<br /><br />In some ways.<br /><br />Really, I'd have to say these are quite different programs, rather than one being substantially better.<br /><br />Tell Me More is a like a class in a box.  There is a mix of exercises that help to build vocabulary, sentence structure, writing, pronunciation, and other aspects.  Each section has a large mix of short lessons that reinforce the learning without becoming dull or tedious.  Save yourself taking language classes by using Tell Me More.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone is a lot less like taking a class.  It's more like finding yourself on an island with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.  And if you want to learn how to thrive on this island, then you follow their patient, but focused, teaching.  The lessons advance by building on previous lessons, adding grammar and vocabulary in small increments without being separate focus.  Rosetta Stone goes for whole learning, approaching the language as a whole rather than in separate topics.  Also, there is a tracking system so that after a certain amount of days a review lesson pops up that makes sure what was learned a couple of weeks ago is still there.  Good confidence boost too.<br /><br />This approach sticks, and it is effective.<br /><br />My only quibble is I'm not sure it's quite worth the amount of money they are asking.  Indeed, if money isn't an issue then by all means go with Rosetta Stone.  There are qualities that do set it apart, and it helps a person feel much more involved in the language and less like taking a class. I see it also as a continued resource way beyond the initial run through, providing a consistent platform to keep the language sharp.<br /><br />The island analogy is also appropriate because Rosetta Stone doesn't have nearly the same amount of cultural exposure that Tell Me More does.  The Tell Me More program offers more German (as in the country) exposure, along with Austria and Switzerland.<br /><br />Tell Me More also has a more potent vocabulary push, especially early on.  Rosetta Stone takes a long while to build a foundation and with this can become pretty repetitive.<br /><br />But, if money is an issue Tell Me More is comparable in quality, without being nearly as expensive.<br /><br />That's not a slam against the product quality of Rosetta Stone at all. It really is an extraordinary software, and revolutionizes language learning.with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.

I had NO IDEA it applied to the physical copy because I have never heard of a limit on hard copies before! I emailed the company and asked this question (very slow response time plus they do not read the emails completely so that you have to re-email the questions that were not answered causing a wait of another day). They confirmed that it can only be installed on two computers because of the license code ---- company policy I am told. Supposedly you can email them and they will 'adjust' the license code so it can be installed on another computer...what a HASSLE....what if the company no longer exists when one decides to do this?!

First off, I purchased this version because it is cheaper than version 2 and you can upgrade to version 2 for free on the company's website.  So I am actually running version 2.  It is quite creepy to see the toolbar on my mac in the unity mode.  One frustration is that you can't (as far as I know) move the toolbar to another location on the screen, so I have to move my dock to the side of the screen to be able to access the toolbar.  Another weird thing is that sometimes my Windows drive on my mac desktop disappears.  I think that's usually after I have ran VMware fusion.  I think it's mostly a pretty intuitive program.  It doesn't seem to slow down my mac much, although I haven't done too much with it at this point.  The Windows side does seem to run a little slow, but it's Windows.  Overall, I like the program and I am happy with the purchase.  You'll probably want to check out the manuals on the website to answer some random questions.	2009-01-18

Since he had done so well with the 128k, and I had some extra money and I wanted to see if he was as good with refurbishing 2004-2010 PCs running XP through 7 as he was with Macs.<br /><br />Well, I bought it home and was going to make backup media, but Windows Vista Home Basic didn't support that function. That was not a good start, but I can say except for the streamlining done to Windows 7, it beats Windows 7 Starter until you get to Windows 7 Starter SP1, which supports a newer version of Internet Explorer than Windows Vista Home Basic.<br /><br />But then again, so do 8 and 8.1 support a newer version of Internet Explorer than Windows Vista Home Basic, hence the title of my review.<br /><br />I do like Vista Home Basic compared to Windows 8 and even somewhat compared to Windows 7 Starter, but the title of my review properly explains it.<br /><br />When I found Vista Home Basic didn't support making reinstall media, I installed Windows 7 Professional on the laptop that had this loaded on it, and I got everything I loved about Vista Home Basic on this laptop with everything that it lacked.<br /><br />Not to bash Vista Home Basic, because if it's legal, retail, and full install all three it can be updated to be perfectly serviceable and I would love a retail copy of my own for a Dell OptiPlex GX400 that is running XP that is about to go out of support and I don't want to bloat it down with Aero, but here's the reasons why I upgraded to Windows 7 Professional:<br /><br />1. Aero like on Vista Home Premium and above.<br />2. Aero 2.0 enhancements including the Superbar and Snap/Peek/Shake.<br />3. Windows Media Center and full games support after loading the code from the DVD.<br />4. All the same legal, retail, and full install all three advantages of retail full install Home Basic that the reseller loaded.<br />5. It improved my opinion of Vista Home Basic from &#34;utter crap&#34; to &#34;Windows 7 without the reasons to want Windows 7&#34;, which is why despite it's limitations, which I will be the first to admit it is limited, I am giving it four stars.<br />6. Internet Explorer upgradeability to version 11 after installing SP1, which Vista Home Basic got screwed out of.<br />7. Upgrades to DirectX and other functional bits beyond what Vista can offer.<br /><br />Now, 6 reasons why Vista (specifically Home Basic legal retail full install) has appreciated with time:<br />1. It doesn't expect your computer to support Aero, thus meaning if your computer supports the minimum system requirements you can be on a par with the level of functionality present in Windows 7 RTM if not SP1.<br />2. It supports the essentials of the shared Vista/7 experience, even if Aero isn't supported even on hardware that could run it.<br />3. It's much better than Windows 8, which is the originally planned follow on to Vista formerly known as Blackcomb that takes the rather radical Vista and makes it seem infinitely more manageable even without the Windows 7 face-lift,<br />4. It does support IE9, so you will be able to do a little bit as regards HTML5.<br />5. You may not like the new taskbar in Windows 7 that 8 even removes the Start menu from and you may not be able to find legal Home Premium or better Vista (I bought an OEM copy of Home Premium and someone had already used it, rendering it illegal after 30 days and leaving me wishing I had bought a copy of this.<br />6. It's so low-end on the Windows feature totem pole that the number of pirated copies is likely to be far less than, say, Vista Ultimate, 7 Professional, or 7 Ultimate.<br /><br />Bonus reason to cover the 2 service packs: Windows 8's interface in the desktop is butt ugly. The corresponding look for Metro is much better, if you don't mind the nickel and diming Metro puts you through.) If you thought Windows Vista Home Basic had a plain interface, just try Windows 8's desktop mode and you'll suddenly be wishing it wouldn't require THAT much effort (2 service packs and countless intervening updates, plus IE9 and a Platform Update once you're just about through) to reinstall Vista Home Basic if that's what you upgraded to 8 from on the promo.<br /><br />So now that you've heard the reasons why it's good and the reasons why I replaced it with Windows 7, you know that it's not perfect but with time it has seemed less radical due to how much more radical 8 is by taking Vista to the next level. Which was Microsoft's intent with the Whistler-Longhorn-Blackcomb OS evolution that later turned into XP-Vista-8 with a detour at 7 so Microsoft wouldn't go bankrupt from ever more insufferable OS choices.<br /><br />Given the true story as only a historian who relies on hundreds of sources can tell you, you can see why I am no longer using it but that I do rate it highly for what it is instead of what it isn't. Thus I am being fair to both the Vista bashers and the Vista zealots, an unpopular position I know, but the right one to take given the information I have dispensed.	2014-02-25

The Zone Alarm appears to work reasonably well and effective up to a point.  However, it does not stop enough junk messages finding their way into ones e-mail, but still worthwhile. <BR>The key point worth sharing here is that Broderbund provides no technical support in my experience. They &quot;wave the flag&quot; that they provide 1) Extremee Online Self-Help; 2) Responsive Email Tech Support; and 3) Committed Customer Service.  I had a problem when my provider made a change and Zone Alarm would not work.  I asked Zone Alarm, via e-mail, for troubleshooting assistance --- namely was there any attention actions other than un-installing and re-installing.  I sent 3 differeent messages during a 30-day period, all linked to the same case #.  The only response was a machine form-letter that they would respond within 1-2 days. BUT, they NEVER followed up.  The only telephone number for contact is a sales/order office.  They operate like a restuarant with no restroom.

It has been some time since I used Photoshop Elements, and the editor itself is still pretty good. My heartburn comes from the Organizer, which is pretty lame.<br /><br />I have a fairly modern computer and with about 50,000 photos (190Gb worth), the Organizer is a dog.  It is slow, and it locks up frequently. Even backing up the catalog requires 180Gb of file space - which is ridiculous.  Why does a backup take up so much room?<br /><br />I also have Photoshop Lightroom, which is basically a high-end organizer, and it behaves a lot better.  Although I'll have to upgrade from Ver 3 at some point.<br /><br />Thing is, if you want to buy Elements for photo editing, it works very well. But if you have a decent number of photos, forget the Organizer.<br /><br />Update. After extensive use of Premiere Elements (the video editor) the time lapse function is nothing short of lame.  You can capture a time lapse from the webcam - which is worthless. It would be nice if you could capture a time lapse from a video you made with a camera!  And if you try to make a time lapse with individual photos - your only choice is 30fps. Even the lowly Quick Time Pro Player is better than that.<br /><br />While it has some nice features, it seems like yet again Adobe does not understand it's customer's needs. Come-on, capture time lapse video is limited to the web cam?  Stupid!	2013-05-05

It is really as bad as the previous reviewers have stated. Using it for anything other than balancing your checking is not recommended. You simply cannot trust the investment calculations that Quicken produces. I am now looking for alternate software to manage my investments.<br />There are so many things wrong that one doesn't know where to begin. Just one small example. When you minimize Quicken, the icon appears on the Windows taskbar. When you try to restore Quicken by clicking on this icon, it rarely works. Of course, it works correctly for every other program, but not Quicken. You then just either alt-Tab to get back to Quicken or minimize every other program on the desktop first. Annoying. But Quicken is full of annoyances. <br />Quicken cannot handle stock transactions correctly. It you do something as startlingly complex as automatic reinvestment of divdends into a security, Quicken increases the cost basis of the security by the amount of the dividend. Wrong! There are numerous examples of this.<br />In short, a very bad, very buggy, very annoying product which I wish I had never installed.

Learn Hebrew - Beginning Level [Old Version]	Software	5	17	20	N	N	Eurotalk ~ designed for the tourist who likes to know	Eurotalk is a UK company who puts out Language Software to many languages, from Native American Indian, such as Navajo, to Asian such as Japanese, and Semitic such as Hebrew. <br /> <br />There used to be only 3 CDs.  One CD was for kids, Two CDs were for adults.  Talk Now was a beginners 'barely conversational' CD for anyone who had little experience in that language, and World Talk was for the more experienced.  The CD for kids was called Vocabulary Builder and is available for most languages, though sometimes it is only available special order via Eurotalk's Website as well as are many less popular languages.   <br /> <br />Presently, there are 4 CDs.  The software has been updated for versions of Mac OS X and Windows XP, and one more CD towards adults was added to the mix called Talk More.  IN TALK MORE IS WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL SCRIPTS OF A LANGUAGE ARE EXPLAINED.  The script is only given in Talk Now CDs so you can recognize it in print when you are in the country, and presently bonuses as for familiarity when you use Talk More after finishing with the Talk Now CD.   <br /> <br />Talk More was introduced because of the vast difference from Talk Now(barely conversational) to World Talk(a good bit conversational).  Talk More introduces any unique scripts of the language, such as Japanese Kana, and further immerses you into getting to be tolerantly conversational.  Or at least understanding conversational speech. <br /> <br />To be frank, studying language by computer via a computer program will help you understand others, and may help you read at some point, but will not help others understand you. <br /> <br />So, the order is <br />1. Talk Now <br />2. Talk More <br />3. World Talk <br /> <br />All that explained, there are three primary contestants of the companies that offer various programs for learning multiple languages.  Rosetta Stone, which offers online and offline programs which are very expensive, though good.  Transparent Language, which offers an attempt to teach conversational language in a single program, which has annoyingly small buttons for going from one phrase or word to the next.  Eurotalk, which has a three level program for many languages and a two level program for others, and a one level for the least known. <br /> <br />This program, Talk Now, is a good program, which generally requires headphones for decent sound output on laptops.  If you are into knowing how to seriously read hebrew, check out davka, though it wouldn't hurt if you went through these first.	2006-10-23

I've been using HD Pro 6.0 for about 9 months now, and as a hobby I've done probably 25 complete home designs of various types and configurations. I also have about as many more that aren't completed, yet.<br /><br />There have been very few things that I haven't been able to figure out how to represent graphically. But if you're planning to build--hire a professional after you have realized your concept with this program. The program (which is feature-reduced from Chief Architect) isn't quite sufficient for accurate materials lists or for showing proper construction techniques. For those you will need the Chief Architect program, at least. And you will also need to suddenly become a skilled, professional builder or architect. So, if you're not one of those already, go hire a professional and show them what you want (by using the program).<br /><br />As for the program, it is as complete and as easy to use as any of the others. I have used 3D Home Architect (the current version), and HD Suite/Pro are superior. The \\"Pro\\" version, at about $500, isn't for the beginner, but I do question exactly who it is best positioned for. Pros would need Chief, and the tinkerer cannot justify $500. I bought it mainly for the abilitiy to create custom roofs (which Suite won't do), among other things.<br /><br />As for defects in the software--there is NO defect-free software. The question is: do the defects seriously imapct your ability to get useful work done? I would say no, but if you're doing anything with curved walls--beware! These are the most \\"twitchy\\" part of the program, and I have easily crashed the program a hundred of times. Fortunately, the program does auto-save, and I habitually save my plan many, many times while editing, anyway. I can almost predict when the program will get into trouble, just by the way it behaves. For straightforward things you should not have a problem. Really.<br /><br />As for hardware, as long as your PC is 3 years old or newer, you should be fine. You might need to upgrade the memory to 512 MB and replace the video card if you don't have one that supports OpenGL, but an OpenGL video card is less than $100. These days, 256 MB of memory is also well less than $100. Just be aware of these things if you expect fast performance.hould be fine.

Lots of problems with this version (I'm running Win98, had Virus Scan V4 prior to this, I do not run the firewall, I recommend  ZoneAlarm's freeware vesion):<br />1. System settings do not stay set; various components are enabled/disabled, seemingly at random, at each boot-up.  Sometimes the kernel itself does not even load, the system tray icon shows bright red and you have to right-click and select RUN to start it.<br />2. Rulaunch failure messages occur all the time.  What is rulaunch?!?!  It's very annoying.<br />3. The &quot;update to the McAfee virus scan&quot; process (not the DAT files, thank goodness) crashes every time so I can't even load an updated version if they ever fix these problems.  I had to change my auto-update feature to MANUAL.<br />4. At boot-up it &quot;appears&quot; that the system is performing a hard drive scan, or something!  Ever since I installed this software the boot-up process is at least 3 minutes longer after all the systray icons appear...no messages, just hard drive access.  However, under &quot;View and edit scheduled scans&quot; all of the drive scans say &quot;not scheduled&quot;.  Interesting that it also claims that VShield was last launched on Dec 16th when in fact I rebooted my PC on 1/4/01.<br />5. HAWK for Outlook always shows &quot;Inactive&quot;, it is impossible to change it to &quot;Active&quot;.  Does this mean it is or is not functioning?  Who knows....the manual and the web site won't tell you either.<br />6. After reading these reviews (unfortunately, AFTER I had purchased the software, duh) I'm afraid to attempt an uninstall.<BR>I was desperate when purchasing the product, my PC had a virus and V4 was dead...should have taken the hint there.<br />7. The technical support web site has no answers for any of these problems or questions.	2002-01-06

I don't know whether to label this entertainment or educational software.  We gave it to our 10 year old at Christmas and he literally played it non-stop for days on end.  It was so much fun, everyone in the family took a turn.  I was impressed by how much our 10 year old learned by creating the fantastic machines with the software.  The software starts the user out very slow, teaching the basics of gravity powered \\"devices\\", steam powered, electrically powered, etc. and then requires the user to create a machine (actually a \\"chain reaction of machines\\") to complete specific tasks.  The tasks become increasingly harder and complex. You don't have to stay within the structured program, however, since the software allows you to freelance and create machines of your own just for fun.  This is a well written software program and is tremendous value for the money.  The software installed quickly and ran smoothly on our moderately equipped Dell desktop running Windows XP Home Edition.	2006-02-12

I was a bit miffed, as he has a PC laptop for work, but we're a Macintosh household, really. Why bother buying this thing that, after he has to go through a myriad of network copying just to get the files where he can edit them?     This thing sat around for years after he was done copying his old HI8 tapes, but I could never get up the courage to make the kind of work around he did just to use an amateur level product. Pinnacle came out with a version for Mac, later, which ended up just sitting on my Wish List, unbought.     The other day I got curious, did some poking around, and found a third party driver that made this thing work on my Mac! 30 bones got me \\"VideoGlide\\" by EchoFX, and it seems to work just fine for me. Total amateur controls, but the video and sound quality are good. It makes nice Quicktime movies, which I'm compiling before my video tapes turns to dust. Anyway, I was chuffed I didn't have to throw this away OR buy something new. The software needs a bit of tuning up (couldn't get the mono setting to work) but it WORKS. I haven't the foggiest about the Pinnacle software, I didn't need it.     There is some sound synching problems when you do a lot of fast forwarding or rewinding on your tape. I just stopped the tape, gave a pause for a breath, and started it up again. It seems to synch up fine after this.     The product itself feels SUPER cheap. I also had to use my Dremel to widen the hole for the S-Video input, which seems pretty janky to me. Ce la vie, the hardware inside is the key.     I haven't seen any cheaper products that work on Mac (at least with decent results), so this gets a \\"perfectly OKAY' review from me.	2009-03-16

This is my opinion in brief: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) makes interesting to buy both.<BR>DVD or CD? Both editions are actually the same. You can copy them in your hard disk.<BR>TEXT: Britannica is a superb encyclopedia in text (not in visual aid) since 1768 (you know: an article by Einstein and so on...). Text in electronic version differs from printed encyclopedia (very large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more items than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like &quot;Mexico&quot; are only one (with a lot of subdivisions) in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are unconnected, and you must &quot;jump&quot; from one subdivision to another, which is slow and very annoying, especially if you want to copy it in \\"WORD\\". Very often, the text is not updated.<BR>In the other hand, Encarta's text is not bad at all. Most articles have the name of their contributors (professions, works...): They are not John Doe. You can find large fragments of literary works, literature guides, a lot of sidebars and thousands of quotations. \\"Encarta Africana\\" is included. The Pop-Up (double clicking a word) Dictionary and Thesaurus has sound for correct pronunciation (by the way, it can read aloud, with a robotic and ugly voice, a whole article). The \\"Translation Dictionaries\\" to Spanish, French, German and Italian must be improved, because they are minimal. It gives you a lot of \\"Internet links\\", even if you are not connected. With Britannica you must be \\"on-line\\" and it searches in an EB Web page.<BR>In theory you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work: You can not find new files. Encarta can be updated free EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions or corrections to the old ones (till October 2004). With Encarta updating really works. Technically, is amazing to see the changes in old items.<BR>ATLAS Britannica has not a real atlas; only a worlds map whose maximum detail is the States of USA. Statistics are very poor. Encarta's Atlas is like another encyclopedia, with a great detail (1 cm/ 4 km all over the world) and 20 types of atlas presentations (statistical ones can be counted by dozens). If you look a geographical article (city, river...) you can see in a corner where it is placed and, with only a click, open the atlas. In articles of cities, if you are on-line, you can see in another corner the weather of this place in that moment. If it is a USA place, you can read the latest news.<BR>MULTIMEDIA: They say that &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;adult&quot; readers do not care about &quot;pictures&quot;; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. Works of art, anatomy, historical maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, charts &amp; tables, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, 360-degrees views, timeline, games... It is not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated.  Britannica is not really multimedia. It has photos and videos, but they make the program slow and sluggish. They should edit an alternative version with only text, as they did with the first edition in 1995. It worked fast and easy in old computers.<BR>INTERFACE AND PERFORMANCE: This is the worst side of Britannica. With Encarta you only have to type a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you automatically alternative spellings. Even if you write the name of a small village lost in any country, you see it in the atlas. If you need to copytext or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. It has additional ways to find content, including subject or multimedia browsing, \\"related articles\\" and the standard A-Z method. The \\"Research Organizer\\" is very helpful too. Encarta's TEXT FONT is very clear (Britannica's...) and you can choose 3 sizes.<BR>Navigating with Britannica is different. 2004 edition is better than 2003 one, but still it is disappointing. I will only give you an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with similar spellings (unless you open a window and fight with it). As I said before, the program's performance speed is very slow and sluggish, and it must be dramatically improved. To go \\"back and forward\\" you do not find any icon and you need to open a \\"menu\\".... One &quot;pro&quot; for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh.<BR>I repeat my modest piece of advice: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) make interesting to buy both.	2004-05-10

Apple has long been an industry leader in innovation to produce productivity, stability and a friendly user experience.  This pattern of success continues with Apple's current iteration of the Mac OS, Mac OS X Tiger (10.4.x).   <br /> <br />Apple's newest OS runs on a Unix foundation, making it one of the most stable, secure operating systems on the planet.  Coupled with tons of software built-in and thousands of other titles to choose from, Mac OS X is a computer user's dream. <br /> <br />I could talk about a thousand cool new features in Tiger, but I'll just point out one of them today, which is to me the most valuable feature introduced in the recent version of the Mac OS.  Spotlight, a super fast search tool, is built right into the OS and allows you to search content - not just file names - on your hard drive.  Using Spotlight I find Word documents, iTunes downloads, contacts, emails, images and so forth.  The possibilities are endless with Mac OS X. <br /> <br />Whether you're a current Mac user considering the upgrade to Tiger or a Windows user considering the switch, this OS is for you.	2006-03-02

The product arrived safely and it installed perfectly fine onto a Lenovo computer, but problems occurred with it much later.  After Thanksgiving of 2014, I went back to using it, but I encountered a mind boggling error. . . every brush, every tool, every feature was deleted . . . gone and never showed up again.  I tried various things that might fix it, such as un-installing it and re-installing it, never helped, only installed a blank page.  Default was my only choice, but a ton of the brushes were missing and all the stamps were gone.<br />I suspected that someone, over the holiday, had accidentally deleted something important.  After doing what I could, I also noticed that the pen of my tablet would no longer move the courser on the screen.  It was a rechargeable pen, but after recharging it, it still did nothing.  Then I gave up on it all together after the program could not be closed out. I tried installing it onto an HP laptop, that worked, everything's there, but the brushes lag and jerk.<br /><br />So that's what I've experienced with my product, i'm not sure if anyone else has had this happen before.  I would not buy this product again or anything related to it.  I don't hate it nor do I love it...	2015-01-12

I have had two Kindle Fires go missing (most likely left at doctor office waiting rooms) and have not recovered either one, so I know how frustrating it can be to have a valuable device get stolen. While I generally like Norton products, this program added little over the free solutions that are available to justify the expense of this package.<br /><br />The package actually sends you the Norton site for the install and is a somewhat cumbersome process that requires you to set up an account if you don't already have one. I bailed out once it became obvious that it was going to be more troublesome.<br /><br />CFH	2013-05-15

It's simple, well designed and customizable. The best way to explain One Note is to say it's like MS Word and Excel combined... it's a Word Processor with Spreadsheet \\"tabs\\". <br /> <br />The main reason I bought One Note was because I had 30-40 seperate word documents that I accessed regularly. It was cumbersome and inefficient. One Note fixed that. <br /> <br />Also, One Note has a good search tool, and also I like the formating options. I only gave it four stars because I wish that they included Excel tables with some basic calculating capabilities. <br /> <br />If you need a program to take notes, consolidate various documents and get organized, I'd recommend it.	2004-12-08

The fee is in the range of 100 to 395 depending on the deal the intuit rep decides to give you.  I would give this less than 1 star because the company (intuit) condones unethical practices and hides the real cost to the customer.  I contacted customer service at intuit 3 times before buying to ask them to confirm the number of employees supported by this version of payroll. I could not get a clear reply from them, they even claimed that they didn't know what Amazon was selling, even though I gave them the link and intuit is listed as the seller on Amazon (chat copies are available).  Because our accountant only knows quickbooks, I bought it. After I installed quickbooks pro, I went ahead to activate payroll for quickbooks. (which by the way is only 7 MB on the CD).  I went through the activation process which confirmed the cost of 100 for the upgrade to the extended version of the payrol for quickbooks 2012. I clicked the \\"submit\\" button to complete the order but my credit card was declined. I contacted the bank and they confirmed no attempted charges were made. After the third attempt, the software gave an error and activated itself for 3 employees. The activation was made without user input.  Now, you might say \\"that's OK\\". Actually it is not. Because now when you go to activate payroll from within quickbooks 2012 interface, they ask for the full price of 395 USD to get the extended version of payroll for more than 3 employees.  I called customer support at intuit 3 times; the discount I was offered differed each time depending upon my tone of voice.  It looks like this is going back to intuit for a full refund. I don't know if it helps any, but I might also present this to the BBB (better business bureau) and FTC.	2012-02-20

I'm simply a computer user, have 7 of them in my house including Macs and PCs. I love them all equally.    I have had Windows XP for long time and decided to upgrade to Vista. My specs are not bad at all:    Intel Core Duo  4GB RAM  NVIDIA Quadro FX 5500 / 1GB GDDR2    The disc is packaged very nicely, they know how to catch attention. Really beautiful experience opening the box.    Installed like a charm. Installed in about 15 minutes, no lags or anything. Rebooted, expanded all files, rated performance and created me a user account.    Now, let's see. I installed ALL of the updates for the system. Rebooted. Downloaded iTunes. Started the installation and BOOM.. the infamous Blue Screen of Death. Okay..    I put in Doom 3 in my drive in hoping to play it. At about 99% the installation locked up and another Blue Screen of Death.    So then I decided to put some Photoshop. Installation started but then closed with a weird error message. I ran in the compability mode for XP SP2 and yay, I installed it. Started playing around with PS and then BOOM.. BSOD again.    And so with all this it just brings up one obvious question -> What The Hell???.. I have never had any problems like that EVER in XP. Someone really was desperate to end the beta testing when it should of been far from over.    While some people have succeeded in getting Vista to work for them I suggest to wait at least until SP1 is released for this software.     Of course I have got most of my programs to work. And when they did work they work amazingly well. Except for PhotoImpact (when I start it the PC goes into the Vista Basic theme).    I really suggest getting either Ultimate or Home Basic version -> there is a hack to enable Aero Glass in it (if you really care so much for eye candy) simply because you either want a system for every-day use or a basic system for once-a-week activities. This Home Premium is just a Frankenstein edition...	2007-04-08

I have have not had one problem with it at all. It has not slowed my pc down at all and I have tried all the antiviruses the free stuff that never works and gives you a virus if you don't buy it, as well as the paid for antiviruses and they all have ran slow but this one. Other programs took forever to update especially Norton and Karpinski, as a matter of fact after installing Karpinski on my friends PC it ran so slow that we couldn't do anything on his PC, he was running windows 7. I say if your using vista or XP webroot is the way to go. I can say that it is a fact that this program has caught every virus I have ever gotten and took it off my PC instantly. I have never used a better product.

One year I struggled with it and the second year I was really pleased.  This year I crashed.  Never will I use Turbo Tax again.  Since I need to do some things the regular way and some with self employment tax, I bought the big package...and added $10 more for Home and Business.  What a waste.  The directions were unclear.  I couldn't get both self employment and the other part to work.  I finally had to take my taxes to an accountant and pay another $150 to get them done.  And, then, the outside of the box says \\"free eFile\\".  Well, what it means is ONE eFile, either Federal or State.  All else costs $20 each.  Everything on Turbo Tax costs a little bit more after you've paid a hefty price for the program.  Never again!!	2010-04-14

Dragon Dicate 4.02 does allow you to dictate into Word for Mac but it is impossible to get the recognition window to appear.  If you use Pages 09 (note that Dictate is not compatible with the latest version of Pages, only Pages 09) or the notepad then the recognition window appears as expected but as soon as you switch into Word it disappears which renders it fairly useless.  This problem is not unique to me as many other users have complained and there is no solution yet.<br /><br />As always with Dragon for Mac,  the actual engine and word recognition is great but this is offset by a clunky interface which has not changed at all and bugs such as the one mentioned above.<br /><br />I feel cheated for having invested a lot of money for an expensive upgrade to find that the software looks and feels exactly the same and the one feature I need (compatibility with Word) doesn't actually work.  I also couldn't get the software to work at all with Safari although this was not an important feature for me so I didn't persist.<br /><br />This upgrade should have been a free improvement - I see no reason for relaunching a new version number if the software is exactly the same.  All the marketing hype about 64 bit and speed is not true in my experience so far, to me it feels exactly the same as before.<br /><br />I've used Dragon on Windows and Mac for at least 10 years and I've been perennially disappointed with the Mac versions.  The actual engine is excellent and hence 3 stars rather than 1 or 2 but the interface is very poor and the software is always buggy.  I also find that the bugs are rarely fixed.  I'm always tempted by a new version (as I have been this time around) because I hope everything will be fixed and improved but this version is not really an improvement.  There has been some marketing hype around increased speed and accuracy but from a practical point of view I can't see adifference.  The problem with this product has never been accuracy which is excellent, it is the interface and reliability that are the problem.	2014-04-18

I can't handle them both!\\"  4) Finally: Go with Apple's already-built-in BOOTCAMP... and get a REAL not virtual environment going... one that will run Windows 7 seamlessly and let you mult-task to your heart's content    Sorry Parallels... you look good on paper.. but imho, that's as far as you go, in my book at least...	2010-01-02

This is our third version of Microsoft FrontPage.  We started with FrontPage 98, upgraded to FrontPage 2000, and have just moved to FrontPage 2002.  Unfortunately, we are not convinced that this product is any better than the last version.  <br />To give you an idea of how much we use FrontPage -- we have been told by both Microsoft engineers and our Web hosting company that our OfficeLinks.com web site is one of the largest that they have ever seen published with FrontPage. It currently exceeds 5,000 pages.  However, it has become virtually impossible to update the shared borders that we utilize throughout the root web.  It took our web hosting company 1.5hrs, using direct server commands, to recalculate all of our hyperlinks!  We don't blame all of this on Microsoft, since we should have used sub-webs more - however, Microsoft may want to prevent (or warn) users not to include more than 100 pages in any web, or sub-web.<br />Additionally, there are two real problems from our perspective that have appeared in the latest version of FrontPage. (1st) First, it is no longer possible to copy hyperlinks into the \\"Insert Hyperlink\\" text box.  The right mouse button seems to be disabled.  This makes adding hyperlinks directly much more difficult - We now have to add a dummy hyperlink and then go into the HTML code and do a \\"paste shortcut\\" - this adds a few extra steps every time we want to add or update hyperlinks.<br />(2nd) The second real problem, which others have also identified on this board, is the way the underlying HTML code is generated.  FrontPage seems to add little things like &lt;span&gt; when you are working in the WYSIWYG Editor to the underlying HTML code.  This is so poor that you actually start to get spelling mistakes when you are re-working pages.  We now have to check the underlying HTML code on every page, which almost makes the WYSIWYG editor useless.<br />There has been one real improvement with FrontPage 2002 that we would also like to point out.You now have the ability to publish individual pages directly to your Web site.  This is a big improvement, since it doesn't take OfficeLinks 30 minutes to make a change any more.  Individual page changes can be made rapidly.<br />We have so much invested in this program, that we are not ready to switch to another program just yet, but if some of these issues are not addressed before the next full upgrade, we may consider moving to a new platform.<br />We can't really call the latest version of FrontPage an upgrade, since some of the features and functions have actually gotten worse.	2001-10-03

Has some video display bugs with color distortion in games like Sims 4 and Everquest. This can be fixed in Sims 4 by setting the display resolution lower and being on an external display. However, I found no workaround for Everquest. Hope Parallels fixes this issue. The weirdest thing is that you can (even on Desktop v9) is that you call install DirectX 11, however Parallels only supports DirectX 10 in the VM setting. So Parallels needs to come clean on it's technology roadmap supporting DIrectX versions and how it is going to support the video mapping on their VM to Mac's video.

In Windows, I used Word for a long time and more recently had moved to Open Office (although I'm not thrilled with it either).  I wanted to avoid Microsoft Office in general and then read very bad reviews of the recent version for the Mac so I looked at reviews for other Mac word processors.  From the reviews, it looked as if Pages would best meet my needs so I purchased IWorks.  Pages approaches the page in a very different way than the windows programs with which I'm familiar and has been very difficult to find some of the features I commonly used.  Some, such as inserting a page break, require going to menus and have no short cuts available.  Other common tasks (at least for me) require you to go to Inspector which is silly.   Some formatting issues continue to evade me - for example, I regularly had documents that include sections that were portrait and other sections that were landscape.  For the life of me, I haven't been able to figure out how to do this in Pages.  If it is available, it isn't obvious to me.  Another piece that I find extremely frustrating is that you can only save or read a document in two formats - pages or doc - and it always defaults back to pages, which nothing in windows can read.  And if I save a file as a doc file and then try to close it, it asks me if I want to save it, warning that not saving it will lose the changes I've made.  Of course, it is only trying to get me to save it as a pages file.  I can export a document into a few other formats... but that is more extra steps and stills wants the primary document to be saved as a pages file.  It also will not open any of the open office documents I have while text edit does... so to access those older documents, I must open them in text edit, save them as a doc file and then I can open them in pages.    I can imagine that for some folk it might work very well and it is possible that people who are more familiar with Mac's might find it more intuitive than I do.  Still, it has been an exercise in frustration for me to the degree that in spite of very bad reviews of Office for Mac and general not good feelings about Microsoft, I have and am considering moving to Office.   When part of the reason for moving to a Mac was to get away from Microsoft!    I haven't used the excel or power point analogs so I can't speak to them.	2011-07-14

I find that I cannot create a really \\"hand-drawn\\" piece of artwork on here easily, as every single line I draw wants to connect to each other. If I freely draw lines that would add up to a mouth, and then I want to use the fill tool to color the mouth red, I cannot. I have to make the mouth, fill it, then put teeth, gums, etc. because it wants me to select that specific piece and fill it. Its a system of shapes. Making a drawing like that is more of a thought out plan than freely sketching.If I were to truly draw out the fill in, the insanity that is the \\"line\\" I drew is, well, its insane. The same goes for using the eraser, I have to select an area or line and then erase it, I cannot simply grab an eraser and have it do its job and move along. It makes every line editable, which I guess is nice if you need that, but I do not and do not see a way to turn that function off. If anyone could inform me of a way to do such, I would appreciate it.<br /><br />Lets summarize-not for doodling, yes for photos, good price.	2012-07-25

Recently I bought this upgrade for my Mac (from CS-2)and it rejected my serial numbers: it seems I had the CS-2 suite, and could not upgrade the photoshop segment alone.

It has essentially every word I've ever needed to look up for normal, non-technical writing.  It's very fast.  The talking feature is nice, but I have to admit that I don't use it often.  As is, the program requires the CD to be in the drive to use the talking feature, but that can easily be circumvented through the use of a \\"virtual CD\\" program such as the one from Farstone. <br /> <br />Why use this and not an online dictionary?  Simple -- availability, speed and flexibility.  The dictionary is always available through a one-click icon in the Quick Launch area.  You don't have to wait for the Internet.  It loads in less than one second on a 1 GHz laptop.  And if you can't find exactly what you're looking for on the first try, one click and you're scrolling through the alphabetical list.  There's always a delay doing that kind of thing on the Internet, even with broadband. <br /> <br />For $5, how can you go wrong?  It's widely available all over the Internet for $5 to $10.

Whatever you think of Nolo's business model, the tool itself works well for creating a complete and sound will.  You can also produce other vital documents like health care power of attorney, financial power of attorney, and so on.<br /><br />It's irritating that Nolo lets each version run only for a year or so and then tries to scare you into buying a new one.  It's irritating that Nolo has dropped support for Mac users.  But none of that affects the basic program, which works and does what you need, UNLESS you live in Louisiana or UNLESS you want to do complex things like place conditions on a bequest.  If you want to do that, you need a real live attorney.  But if all you want to do is leave property to several beneficiaries and make sure your wishes are met in regard to health and financial stuff, Willmaker is great.<br /><br />The much-ballyhooed trust feature is limited in that it just creates the trust.  You still have to transfer things to trust ownership - the same as it would be for a trust made by an attorney.<br /><br />If your needs are really really really simple, you can use forms found online instead of this package.  But isn't your time worth something?  With willMaker you don't have to chase down those forms.  They're right here.  I'd rather pay $50 than spend another 4 or 5 hours looking for valid legal forms.<br /><br />You really owe it to your family and other heirs to make things simple to handle after you die.  A legal will, powers of attorney, and a central place to list your wishes and your assets can only help them.  Just do it.  I've witnessed what happens when a person dies intestate, and it is a world of avoidable trouble.  Spare your family that.	2015-03-06

First of all, I couldn't figure out how to do the things I used to be able to do-- especially in excel.  And what's worse, \\"HELP\\" is not on their \\"ribbon\\" or on the main menu.  You would think that \\"HELP\\" would be prominently displayed on any software menu.  It isn't.  I even had 2 other people try looking for it.  None of use could find it.  I finally had to just hit \\"F1\\", which as power users know, is the short cut key for \\"HELP.\\"      Second, I was not able to customize the ribbon for the items I use most.  The standard ribbon on this product is huge and takes up a lot of room on the screen.  As a general rule, I don't use half of what is on that ribbon.  I would like to customize the ribbon for those items that I do use regularly.  This option has been taken away in Office 2007.      The absolute most frustrating thing, however, is this:  It is not fully backwards compatible so for large spreadsheets created or worked on in 2003 that have lots of links and formulas, IT WILL REWRITE YOUR LINKS AND FORMULAS.     You can skip this part if you want.  It is my litany of how I know this:  I was using 2007 in the office.  My home computer uses 2003.  Since I was losing productivity at work trying to figure out 2007, I started bringing work home-- primarily excel work.  At home, I would make changes to my work, correct formulas, reconcile my spreadsheets, and double check to make sure things were correct.  The next day, I would hand my work to my boss and he would find mistakes.  Some of them so obvious, I kept thinking, \\"Why didn't I catch this problem last night?\\"  I began to doubt my competence and so, unfortunately, did my boss.  Well, it turns out that Office 2007 is not fully backwards compatible and for large spreadsheets with a lot of links and formulas, such as the ones I create, if you go between 2003 and 2007, 2007 WILL REWRITE FORMULAS AND LINK THINGS INAPPROPRIATELY for things done in 2003.  Thus if you send something you create in 2003, to someone who has 2007 (or vice versa), the result may be vastly different from what the sender thought.  A friend and I found that information in a very well hidden blurb on Microsoft's website.  So, I wasn't going crazy, nor was I incompetent.  Office 2007 just SUCKS.    Because of my issues, the entire company's finance department and all other analytic departments in the company, decided not to migrate to Office 2007.    Finally, because Office 2007 is not fully backwards compatible, 2003 users might not even be able to open a document created in 2007.    Bottom line, this is the worst (say 1000 more times) MS product.	2009-07-11

I first loaded this software onto my G4 400 which is running Mac OS 9.21. Installation was a snap and I was quickly surfing the web through Explorer running on Windows 2000. I downloaded the PC only web software and fired it up. Here is where the problems were encountered. I have GB cable and was able to hear incoming audio just fine, but I was unable to get outgoing audio to work on my G4 desktop.<br />Undaunted, I loaded Virtual PC with Windows 2000 on my G4 PowerBook (667mhz) in the hopes that the additional processor speed would cure my recording woes. This machine has OS 10.2 on it, and again installation was a snap. Again I was surfing and downloading the Paltalk.com software and again, I couldn't get Windows to record my voice so that it could be understood. In other words, this software didn't fulfill my sole reason for purchasing it and $185.00 was foolishly spent just to get the Paltalk software to work on one of my Macs. Bummer.<br />Curiously, I've also had difficulties getting Virtual PC to be able to see the CD-ROM which makes me wonder how on earth you are supposed to load any software that doesn't come off the web into the Windows 2000 envirnment.<br />All in all, I could have bought a slow-yet serviceable-used PC for the price of this software. The bottom line: The evil empire is still just as evil even when loaded unto a Macintosh.	2002-12-15

I have used Dragon for years and couldn't work without it, but Dragon 13 (Home version) is hopeless on Windows 8.1. It runs so incredibly slowly, I can read the newspaper before it finishes a paragraph. I'm totally frustrated. I've played with settings and fine-tuned it repeatedly, with no improvement. I'm going to have to go back and buy 12 again (I used up all my installations of the previous disk) to get my work done.    Adding an update a few weeks later: I purchased 12.5 (again) and installed it. It works fantastically, right out of the box. Fast, incredibly accurate, a joy to use. What on earth happened with 13? I see that the price has now been reduced to half the original price. Save your $$ and go with 12.5. THIS is the Dragon I know and have loved!    P.S. If the Nuance representative who has commented on other negative posts is reading, I sure wouldn't mind a refund of the $100 I spent on 13, which went straight down the drain.	2014-11-24

BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />Mistake #1...As a long time Acronis user, I bought True Image 2014 on their former reputation without first going to the Acronis TI 2014 forum...before anyone buys or installs this product, please do yourself a favor and spend a good 30 minutes at the ATI 2014 reading the boatload of problems this software is loaded with.<br /><br />With 2 new machines, I wanted peace of mind...I'm no computer guru but I know my way around disk cloning and imaging.  ATI 2014 is not your Acronis of a few years ago.  It is now bloated with dozens of mostly useless functions, seemingly all of which are loaded with bugs.<br /><br />DISK CLONING - FAILED!  After installing this software on 2 machines, I first tried cloning my hard drives to new Western Digital Black series HDDs in Orico hot swap racks, booting from the Acronis CD, the safest way to clone.  Although Windows saw the drives and wrote the drivers to them, Acronis could not see the Western Digital unallocated drives.  Finally gave up and booted Acronis 2014 thru Windows.  Finally, Acronis recognized the WD HDD's, but failed the cloning operation on both machines, throwing a cryptic error code that is nowhere to be found on the Acronis site.  As a test, borrowed a friend's ATI 2011 CD, and it cloned both drives through RAM.<br /><br />DISK IMAGING - MAYBE THE IMAGE IS GOOD, MAYBE IT ISN'T....although I was able to image both C: drives, and Acronis verified them as good images, the ATI 2014 forum is full of posts from people who didn't find out until the needed to mount the image, that it was corrupt.  No peace of mind here...<br /><br />BACK-UPS - ran two full disk backups, again, maybe they're good, maybe they aren't...read the forum results...<br /><br />TECH SUPPORT?  Practically non-existent...you get only 30 days of tech support for your money, through either (1) online chat, or (2) an e-mail ticket that will take &#34;72 hours&#34; to simply get a response.  My first chat wait was 2 hours and 50minutes, and nobody ever appeared in the window.  Second try consumed over 3 hours before I gave up.  Read the forum!!!  E-mail tickets frequently go unanswered, even long after the 72-hour wait people go through with a machine that won't boot.<br /><br />After 30 days, you pay for tech support per incident, or you don't get it.  30 days isn't long enough to even try half the features or get the ones you have tried working.  Acronis has relegated tech support to the forums, with almost zero presence of Acronis tekkies.  You rely on other users to help you and hope they know what they're talking about...this software has SO many bugs, in my opinion it hasn't even achieved an end-of beta status - apparently Acronis is using paying users to work the bugs out of this product...no peace of mind here...to my knowledge, there have been no product updates or fixes - the few cases of Acronis actually reacting to user's problems consist of work-around after work-around...the program will NOT work by itself without going through work-arounds...and you paying and paying again for a tech ticket that is closed by giving you a workaround.<br /><br />A LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT ACRONIS REFUSES TO FIX:  the dreaded &#34;Operations are in Progress, your machine will shut down when they are complete&#34; - screen - it's a BSOD...I hadn't activated any functions (thank goodness) other than Cloning and Disk Imaging/Back-up...nothing else activated, yet any operation Acronis has running in the background at shutdown can throw this screen - and you're 100% stuck - no way to escape it other than a cold shutdown and the risk of a damaged OS.  After having the scrren totally take over both machines, once for over 8 hours, another time overnight without clearing....NO software should EVER totally lock up your machine with no escape, regardless of any operation it's running.  Yet Acronis has gone on record as saying they will not change this problem function...<br /><br />I FINALLY GOT MY PEACE OF MIND...I uninstalled this software, and thank goodness I bought it at Amazon, returned it....<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE I won't have another Acronis product on my machines again...Macrium Reflect is a much more reliable and tested product for both cloning and imaging....<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Don't take it from me - do what I should have done - spend some time reading the Acronis 2014 forums first, before you decide whether to trust your machine and all your data to this software...Acronis has gone from the best 7-8 years ago to a mess...this software is just plain dangerous....	2014-08-28

They did let me know it ran perfectly, and was an excellent game that fit all their usual gaming requirements. It had fun puzzles that weren't impossible to solve, but had a certain level of challenge to them. It was very involved and had a lot to it, but wasn't impossibly long or boring. Very good game and I'm glad I made the purchase!	2013-03-07

It presents bridge slowly enough however if you have absolutely no knowledge of how to play bridge, good luck. It does have a wonderful way of explaining each hand. You can play along with fixed hands, learn bidding, replay those hands, see how you can get more from each hand. Worth the money. Good for somewhat new players or intermediate players who learned how to play but feel they dont really know bridge well. Not good for very good players or people who want to learn newer convensions. Slightly pricey. Would be better if along with fixed hands were random hands or if it would allow you to set up hand scenarios, however building a teaching program like that would be daunting.<br />Note: This is a part one disk, lessons 1-6. You will want lessons 7 - 12.	2014-09-18

I bought this because I saw that they had upgraded many of the brush variations to include (and this is a feature I wanted most), a series of blending brushes, which were not included on my previous version. I was almost speechless at how well this they worked. It took me no time at all to get used to dialing in the strength and opacity of the blenders so that they would do exactly what I wanted them to do. Also, Autodesk has added \\"synthetic paint\\" brushes that funtion very much like the brushes in Corel Painter---but they actually work without spending twenty minutes on your keyboard, fiddling around until you find something that you'll settle for.<br />  The only beef I have with this version it that some of the paint brushes don't function exactly like they did in the previous version. It's as though these brushes are too complex now, and it's difficult to explain properly, except that I notice them slowing down the system. There is likely a way to overcome this, and when I have more time, I'll work on it. But it doesn't matter; I still have to prior edition, and I use that for these methods when I need it.<br />  I did  not buy this from Amazon, because although I wanted the DVD, I was in a hurry, so I went directly to the Autodesk site and downloaded it in a few minutes.<br />  I really wish I hadn't bought Corel Painter. I could have bought another Wacom pad for what I paid for painter, and gotten more use out of it. But I console myself with the knowledge that someone has finally designed an art program for creative artists, and not overschooled computer wizards and photographers.	2013-04-17

I just had the most amazing resurrection of my computer due to Diskwarrior, and I promised myself my first order of business, if it worked, would be to come on here and tell the world it is SO WORTH IT!!!!  I have an iMac.  I had my whole life on it, and it died on me during a really big project.  I took it into the apple store and they told me there that the disk was not able to be saved.  They couldn't find the disk at all.  I had gotten Error 7, I believe- this disk cannot be repaired.  When they fella there started talking about, &#34;so let's just get this baby a new hard drive and you'll be up and running in no time,&#34; it was all I could do to hold it together.  It was like he was telling me my dog had died and let's just get you a new dog.  I was not going to cry in front of this guy, but I was just trying to keep it together.  I was not going to turn it over to them, because I had heard about Diskwarrior from apple boards and friends, so I tried to keep calm and put it back in the box without letting tears spill.  When the fella walked away the woman waiting at the genius bar next to me softly asked me how long I'd had the computer.  &#34;Six years,&#34; I was able to whisper.  &#34;Shxx,&#34; she said, and I could sense she was saying it with complete and utter empathy for what I'd lost.  I'm a good Catholic mom of eight kids, and I don't tend to use the word myself, but it just seemed appropriate at the time.  Six years of pictures, six years of work....<br />I came home, and it actually took me a few days to order Diskwarrior.  It was the kind of procrastination that definitely stems from fear of failure.  What if I spent $100 only to find out I needed to go spend more on a new hard drive?  I read every review, and I decided it was definitely my best chance.  After I received it I waited a month to try it.  It was right before Christmas, and I just felt if it was really all going to be gone I didn't want to know that at Christmas time.  So here it is,January 19, 2015, and I turned the computer on for the first time since November, plugged in the Diskwarrior disk, and in less than one hour everything is back to absolutely perfect....  I can't even believe it.  Thank you, Jesus!!!!!!!  Thank you, Diskwarrior!!!!!  I hope this review helps someone, and I wish EVERYONE could experience the relief and gratitude I feel!!!!  I will of course now be purchasing several &#34;back up your computer&#34; items both physical and cloud.  Alleluia!!!!	2015-01-19

Since Microsoft discontinued support for ME, the security suite vendors all seem to have abandoned support for ME also. This version of Zone Alarm works with ME (as well as Win 98SE) and new virus definition updates are still available under the subscription from Zone Alarm. When the ME system was upgraded to Win 2000 Pro, the suite was smart enough to recognize this and download the updates for the program. I have used Zone Alarm Security Suite on a number of computers for more than 3 years and have recommended it to many friends (most of whom were frustrated Symantec/Norton users like me); Zone Alarm has never let any of us down.	2007-09-08

Why remove the customisability of toolbars and functions? Why make the interface such that 4 clicks are needed when only 2 were needed previously? Why hide commonly used functions? Why make it effectively incompatible with previous versions?    It's a secret plan by OpenOffice who have infiltrated Micro$oft to make their products so bad that we'll all migrate to Open Office. It must be, that's the only logical explanation for the way the Office 2007 is such a pain to use!    As a business user, we've had all of our customised functions removed at a stroke. Keyboard shortcuts no longer work, macros no longer work and simple operations that could be accessed direct from the keyboard now need 3-4 mouse clicks. the interface is un-instinctive and occupies too much screen space. There are multiple bugs. Everyone who has used it in the office hates it and two of our major customers refuse to accept documents in the new format containing equations. Oh, yes, the equation editor is incompatible with anything previous and only works in the new docx format - which none of our customers will accept for electronic documents.

Camtasia however is simple to use, and does not take long at all to save your exported video. If you are like me and just wanted to take a simple video with your digital camera and then maybe just trim off the start and finish or maybe even cut a little bit out here and there, then camtasia is perfect for doing that.    You simply just import your video file, or record the screen where you want it to, and then drop the video into a Camtasia time-line, highlight the parts you want to edit and simply cut them out. You can also use jpegs, gifs and other pics, and the gifs.    The effects are not much tho, there is a zoom in, picture in picture layer, and transition effects between scenes, but not much else effect wise.    It would be nice to see some more filters and effects in future to change colors, tint, black and white etc... but for now, this is the #1 program I recommend for a simple little editer, to add a quick movie to youtube, without having to have one of those confusing programs that are slow and take up most of your computers resources that render forever like Premiere.    This program lets you easily save in various formats, mpeg, avi, rm, swf, mov, flv, camv and even an animated gif file! It's a simple program, for simple editing.	2010-08-15

But it just got sooooo sloooowwww that I went looking for a new video editor instead of a new computer.<br /><br />Here's what happened - Corel VideoStudio x6 wouldn't even install so that one went by the boards. I had a look at Sony and even a cracked version of Adobe Premiere Pro (which would be my choice if I did video editing for a living), Adobe Premiere Elements, Magix  and a few others but eventually decided to give Cyberlink a harder look after fooling around with the demo. I was glad I did.<br /><br />I edit video infrequently but when I do, I just want to combine my clips, put some music and a few cool transitions and titles in it and not have to re-learn the software to do it. Or wait painfully for the software to catch up to my edits (In Pinnacle, it had to turn the little clock on to just re-draw the timeline and it go soo painful to watch)<br /><br />Cyberlink was easy to learn, the right click context menus are excellent (do you want to overwrite or move all these clips to the right etc. etc.) and while this would get wearying if you did it day in and day out, when you want to just do some editing, it will give you guidance without having to relearn the software and it  just allows you to get the job done. Sometimes simpler is better.<br /><br />It also comes with an excellent &#34;ebook&#34; that if you go through it, you can pick up the features really quick. There's also a lot of chance for tweaking all kinds of effects and edits if you're a power user but if you're like me and don't really need to do a lot, you can just jump in the software and go.<br /><br />But there's more - when I upgraded my AMD Asus moterhboard to the 8350 8 core CPU from my Phenom 4-core, Cyberlink just loved it. Things get done right now. There is no waiting. So I also went back to my Avid Studio software to see what would happen with it. Nothing that you would notice. Still painfully slow.<br /><br />If you value speed, ease of use, lots of features if you really want them, a great user interface, a shallow learning curve and not having to wait for your video editor to think about things too much, I would go with Cyberlink. Works for me.	2014-01-01

This new pricing for additional returns might work in a business environment, but for home users it seems very out of place.    Charging for additional returns is like charging by the document for an office suite, or charging an hourly fee for game play.    The charge per additional return is bad enough, but the increase in price is just not timed well.    Ihave used Turbotax the last few years, but I think I will go back to Tax Cut this year.  I haven't used it since it was still \\"Kiplinger's Tax Cut\\", but I am glad there is an alternative.    Requiring authentication over the internet to print or file?  That is just too invasive and too prone to errors.    No thanks!	2008-12-08

I've been using Photoshop for most of my freelance and professional work for years, so I was hesitant to try something new. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and after doing some research decided to give this a try. Having recently also purchased Sketchbook Pro 7 I was anticipating the drawing experience to feel similar, but certainly not better than PS. I couldn't be more wrong. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the drawing sensitivity/brush engine is far better than those two programs. Sure PS has more options for editing images and filters, but for my purposes, sketching and painting for concept art, its been a dream to use. Highly recommend it is you're looking for a cheaper PS alternative!	2015-01-02

It also handles CSS so much better--there were a few CSS features that I could *never* get to work right on 2004, and it's simple as pie to do it in version 8!

I have DVD's and other books but could never just pick up and play.  I was having a hard time reading the tablature and this software explains everything in such an easy way and has so many different resources available.  It teaches you what you need to know to start playing immediately and teaches you about timing.  I really like the metronome that is on the software plus all of the audio clips to hear every chord and the instructor videos.  It teaches you to learn the chords and then shows how to apply them to songs.  The first song is Brother John (Frere Jacques).  I am a young at heart adult who has never been musically inclined so it just goes to stand to never discredit yourself based on past labels that you or others may have given you.  I have an older laptop that uses XP and this software works great.  I use this software along with The Ultimate Guitar Chord Chart by Hal-Leonard (about $3).  I have found it very easy to prop up my chord reference book to glance at while I use the software. Perfect for any beginner!<br /><br />Update: 6/30/2017 - This software makes it so that even if you have never been musically inclined (I fall into that category) that you can play.  I never thought in a million years that I would be able to pick up the guitar and play.  I am still learning but have added a strap-lock to my guitar along with a neck strap and use Guitar Fingertip Protectors Silicone Finger Guards for Ukulele Electric Guitar (see other reviews on guitar items, including fingertip Protectors) and my skills have really improved.  I also use a Snark to tune my guitar (a must every time you pick up the guitar and play and super important for those of us who still may not be able to hear the difference in all of the notes).

I will have to manually download and install all the drivers for this stuff another day when i have more time.  On top of that as I'm restoring my old software it crashes randomly about 2 to 4 times an hour.  Completely unacceptable.  I've been trying to make my laptop usable again but it just took me two hours to fail at installing Microsoft office 10.  Even though its supposed to be compatible, the pc crashed in the middle of the install.  Unfortunately for me there is no easy way to uninstall a corrupted copy of office.  This took me an hour to figure out that it didn't work and that I had to manually uninstall it with a complex tutorial for a windows 7 pc as given on the windows website even though they don't explain at all how to uninstall it in windows 8.  Because windows 8 is so different from windows 7 it took me a ton of time to figure out how to do it.  After finally getting it uninstalled I tried to reinstall it only to have it crash again midway through the install.  I finally gave up and went to bed and am now reviewing it in anger from my tablet.<br />To summarize, if you enjoy having your pc crash every time you try and open random new programs you download from the Microsoft store or crash just randomly about three times an hour or crash if you try to multitask then windows 8is for you.<br />This software is currently buggy crap and almost completely unusable.<br />If you intend to do anything on your pc at all productive then i highly recommend keeping windows 7 for another year or two or even go with a google or apple OS instead.	2012-12-13

Wouldn't upgrade and wouldn't work, despite what the Microsoft adviser said. Tech support was amazingly bad. They determined that Vista was not compatible with my AMD Athlon processor (I'm sure AMD will be thrilled to hear this). <br /> <br />Microsoft did refund my money, however. I'll give 'em an extra star for that. <br /> <br />Now the full version of Vista that came on my new notebook computer is alright. It runs very nice (though takes forever to boot). <br /> <br />I'm not sure what is happening at Microsoft. Vista is the worst upgrade they have ever delivered -- and they spent billions developing it. I just don't know.	2007-05-15

I was able to layout the graphics and text just like I wanted.  Building animations was really simple and the whole thing looked very professional.    The defaults for all of iWork apps just looks so good, you often don't have to change much.  If you want to customize, that is easy also.

No pronounciation (only symbols).    - Forced registration.  This was very annoying to me since it pops up literally every time and provides NO option to remove.

As noted by others, this is great pricing for the combination of products.  Also, as noted elsewhere, this Enhanced Payroll is only for up to 3 employees.  I called before buying to find out what the cost would be to upgrade to unlimited employees and was told it would be $100.  This matched other reviewer's information that I had read online.<br /><br />When I received the software and activated it online, it asked how many employees...I confirmed 4+ and the website said no problem, we'll charge your Credit Card for $100 more.  Great!  Then I got my CC statement and they charged me $158.05.  Apparently their system decided the lower level is $249 and the 4+ level is $395, so it had to charge me $146 +tax to upgrade...even though the website clearly stated \\"You will only be charged $100 today.\\"  Wish I had a screen grab of this, but I only printed the confirmation after it was all completed, since it seemed to match what everyone else had said.  Now I'm fighting to try and get my money back, but they won't give it back.<br /><br />Looks like it's off to the BBB and FTC with this one. I'm out of ideas.	2012-05-28

I'm going against the tide here - but I LOVE THIS THING!!  I am using it with an old blackberry - to catch my reminders and appointments and calendar.  I am using it synced with YAHOO calendar - and I use my laptop and my work PC with it.      HOW?? - you ask.  Ok, it takes some tweaking and an extra 3 minutes:    I review and schedule everything with the program open and running on my laptop.      I then drag a copy of it over to my thumb drive, so I can run it when I get to work the next day.    I then sync my laptop Plan Plus with my laptop copy of OUTLOOK.      Next, I sync my blackberry with the laptop's outlook.    Finally, I sync YAHOO with the laptop's outlook.    Rumor has it that Franklin Covey has made Plan Plus sync-able with the blackberry directly, now?  I have not yet figured this out.    I love this calendar because it works for me - it captures endless notes, contacts, websites - and allows me to put them in and around my goals - and it allows me to keep my eye on the goals.  I used this program with Jennie Ditzler - Your Best Year Yet - Book and website to keep me on track.  Finally, you can not ask for a more customizable interface.  It's great for the basics - reminders, appt, a million calendar views - and it is awesome for in-depth - sharpen the saw, goal setting, values, mission statement and prioritizing.    So sorry to hear that many folks are not loving this solution.  Especially since I am raving about it.	2007-12-07

I'll try to  touch on features that other reviewers have missed.  Setup is easy, however, if you have enough space on your hard drive I would highly recomend selecting a &quot;full install&quot; when given the option.  This will eat up over a Gigabyte of drive space but you will avoid the hassle of constantly swithching between two CDs when browsing the 2500+ &quot;pre-made&quot; cards.  In fact, you won't need the CDs at all after a full install.  Creating custom cards is a little more involved but the possibilities are endless.  Card Studio makes it effortless to import your own graphics or even incorporate your own photos into a card project.  ONE thing missing that I would like to have is the ability to purchase and add on yearly upgrades.  The 2500 included pre-made cards are not bottomless.  For instance: when searching for &quot;Christmas&quot;, &quot;for Brother&quot; card studio turns up only three cards!  Only one of which I felt was appropriate.  Therefore, next year I either make a custom card, buy a card, or Purchase &quot;Card Studio 2004&quot;.  Of course if Hallmark put their entire card archive into Card Studio they would soon be out of business.  A yearly upgrade option to registered users of Card Studio would seem to be a fair solution.

The <br />documentation says they are going with OFX instead of QIF <br />and that's why I can't import.  I didn't find an OFX import, <br />and I can't do an OFX export.  Basically it was borken with <br />2005 and has not been fixed. <br /> <br />I contacted support and was told that they don't support export <br />and reimport and don't support merging of investment center <br />accounts. <br /> <br />I also don't like the new quick entry investment editor that <br />allows you to edit the rows, but not see the selections for <br />each of the columns (enough to store about 10 characters) and <br />I can't change the column widths.  At least the entry editor <br />from the last version is still available. <br /> <br />This all came up when one of the businesses I use finally now <br />works with quicken after a year of being available but not <br />working.  I expected the data to map to two accounts came <br />in as one set of transactions for one account.  Now I can't <br />get the transacations into the separate accounts nor can I <br />merge the accounts in quicken. <br /> <br />The end result here is that I just continue to enter the data <br />manually and not use the online interface.	2006-03-03

This is by far the most obscure operating system I've ever used and I've been exposed to quite a few, including past versions of Windows, OSX and OS 9, Linux, DOS, etc.<br /><br />To keep my review simple: Windows 8 is an utter disaster. And that's an understatement. It will take you 2 - 20 times longer to get things done on it versus any other operating system out there, including Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a choice, do NOT buy or install Windows 8 on your computer. Stick with Windows 7 or Windows XP, both are decent versions of the Windows operating system.<br /><br />UPDATE ONE: I could literally go on for hours about what is wrong with the interface and functionality of Windows 8, including how even the simplest thing like a rollover effect is wrong (specifically the ones in the corners of the screen when you are on the Start screen: the rollover ends once you move out of the corner, even while you are still over the icon, which is nothing but stupid and frustrating). But I don't think this product is even worth that level of detail. Microsoft can pay me if they want a thorough critique of why this software is so anti-user, but I don't think they care. This was their attempt and being \\"cool and modern\\" and trying to catch up to Apple, but they are so clueless, they totally missed the mark. While parts of the interface are attractive, on a functional level, it's ugly. Kinda like sitting down to a beautiful looking gourmet meal and it tasting like dog crap.<br /><br />UPDATE TWO: There was a time when Microsoft innovated and created powerful software. Windows XP and earlier versions of Microsoft Office come to mind. Under the current (ahem) guidance (if you want to call it that) of Steve Ballmer, they have become a bloated, slow-moving and sinking ship. It's time for Microsoft to get a new CEO, someone with a fresh and true vision for the company. Ballmer doesn't know what he's doing, as he makes clearer each year he remains at the helm.	2013-06-08

I have several times over the last 2 years tried to learn French with living language, and the use of websites and none of them come even close.    The way rosetta stone works is incredible it doesn't make you learn by translation and is immensely interactive. The level set-up is that its broken down into 4 units, and each unit has 4 core lessons(about 30 min each) with additional basic lessons in-between (usually about 5 or more each) and they are either set as reading, listening, speaking or writing. But it is all connected visually. The software again is very interactive.    For the price of the content and what you get for it is great. Some may be skeptical about it, i was at first, but the pay back will be that by the time you finish with either lessons 1-3 or 1-5 you will be able to easily interact, communicate and quickly be able to immerse yourself in the culture who's language you've learned.    Sample: The speaking parts will show you say a dog and will pronounce \\"chien\\" at which point it will prompt you to say the word using the headset your provided and by how you pronounce it it will respond effectively whether you spoke it correctly. Even better if your having difficulty saying \\"jaune\\" = \\"yellow\\" their is a tab that when used will compare your speaking of the word with the 'author' and will show whether your pitch or pronunciation is off.    The only comment i would say is that each lesson should have a library of words that you can go through and practice with at improving your accent and pronunciation.    I am at this moment back at school and i could not imagine sitting in a classroom with 20 other people trying to learn another language. The plus side is you'd have people to practice with but for the time and cost your getting a much better deal just buying Rosetta. i paid 485 instead of 560 from rosetta and am already comfortable and confident with my french.    One of the perks about it is if you have a family or spouse who also wants to learn it allows several users on the program ( you can only have it on one computer unless you buy several levels and install them separately.     Overall if your looking at learning a new language this is the software for you. Try the demo version if you like but for costs sake it is worth the investment. I would be completely dumbfounded if i were to have this on my resume and they would be critical cause i didn't learn it in school given that the government, fortune 500 companies and international organizations use it as their method of learning a new language.	2010-08-21

Our current version is Filemaker 4 which we licensed about 11 years ago. Our primary customer database became corrupted recently and, to our disappointment it wasn't recoverable. So we went to our backup and discovered that the backup software had stopped working in 2008. The database files saved there were fine except they didn't include about 30 months worth of entries.     Our Filemaker 4 had run without any issues in a networked setup which allowed us to access the files from any of our three workstations. We decided to upgrade to the current version 11 and found that no upgrade was offered. We still decided to license and install the current version 11 even though it meant purchasing a totally new license. We reviewed the information at the Filemaker website and saw, among other things, that the sales information stated that it would work on up to 9 workstations simultaneously ... the same as version 4.     So we purchased a new copy and installed it only to find that the rules had changed and now a full license is required for each workstation, bumping our investment cost from $299 up to $897 to equal what we had. It may work on up to 9 workstations simultaneously but only if you are willing to accept an outrageous difference in price.    Next we tried updating our database files to version 11 which worked successfully on all the flat, non-relational ones but was a total bomb on the three which were relational. After 8 hours of tracking down incorrect field conversions with many more remaining, we finally threw in the towel and just went back to using version 4.     For our purposes, Filemaker 11 was a complete waste of money and the company policies as well as their customer service was nothing short of unacceptable. We once recommended Filemaker to anyone who asked. We will now steer anyone who asks away from a great product ruined by a greedy company and a non-backward looking development path that leaves their oldest customers abandoned and twisting in the wind.	2011-04-07

This game is highly priced, but it's definitely a collectors' item in my opinion. Starcraft is a widely known game and I know many many fans. Insurrection was a spin-off title made in the same universe as the original Starcraft, but unlike the original was not made by Blizzard. Rather, this game offers a 'side-story' of sorts, with minor changes to gameplay etc., (think campaign editor) and is really a cool and fun idea and game for hardcore fans - but if you just want Starcraft, then don't look at Insurrection.<br /><br />And to the collectors... it's not like this game is the greatest thing on earth, but I enjoyed playing through it.

I knew this when I bought it but it still should be able to write DL discs.  Dual-layer isn't such a new technology that Premiere can't include it.  Rendering is still slow as with previous versions even though preview is realtime or close to realtime.  Premiere still does not seem to take advantage of today's extremely fast graphics processors included on most video cards.  Avid Liquid 7 uses the graphics processor instead of the CPU for much of the rendering.  Avid Liquid 7 previews realtime and also renders extremely quickly compared to Premiere Pro 2.  The difference is night and day. <br /> <br />All in all, I wish I had not purchased Premiere Pro 2.  It's a good product but it's not good enough when compared to Avid Liquid 7.	2006-06-03

Like millions of others, NO WARNING WAS GIVEN ANYWHERE by MS that this would occur. ONLY if you run Windows 7 will PROGRAM FILES be transferred. So, you have to re-install ALL programs that you had before. The Compatibility Checker tells you what programs will be compatible, but does not bother to tell you that none will be transferred over. Like others, I noticed that the same amount of disk space is utilized as before the upgrade, so what exists there? According to MS the\\" Windows.old\\" folder houses the programs in some \\"altered state\\" that you cannot recover from, and THIS FOLDER WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED BY WINDOWS 8 AFTER 30 DAYS. So, after we figure out if there is anything useful in that folder, we then get to figure out how to extract it. AGAIN, no help is provided by MS on what is there, nor how to use it. They should be required to supply every valid Windows User (Version anything) with a free upgrade to Windows 7 so the Program files transfer to Windows 8. Not even Office 10 programs transfer...nothing! I would suggest that EVERYONE warn their friends, etc. about all the headaches that they are about to encounter IF they try to upgrade a computer to Windows 8. If you are not a techie, and you want to upgrade from anything other than 7, to 8, just go buy a new computer and then on the new machine do a Search, for \\"Windows Easy Transfer\\" and then follow the instructions to transfer files, pictures, etc. And oh, by the way, be ready to spend a boat load of money buying all new programs to work with Windows 8.\\" from a review on Microsoft's Tech Help pages and I concur from my personal experience.	2013-01-03

Maybe you decide to test drive the product. You open it up and click on a word, silence, a definition appears, more writing, no sound, no word is spoken. There is no button for sound.

Let me list the reasons why.<br /><br />1. It is quicker than Adobe Photoshop.<br /><br />2. It has enough functions to do most of the things I need.<br /><br />3. It is easy to use.<br /><br />4. The learning curve is not steep.<br /><br />5. The package is smaller in hard drive size than Photoshop.<br /><br />6. It can do the vast majority of things that Photoshop can do.<br /><br />PS has a very steep learning curve but is the only true Pro package out there, however how much of PS you think you will use depends on the type of work you are doing. I would recommend PSP just on the basis that you can get it working right out the box by just learning the basic interface.<br /><br />I use this package an awful lot. I even do complex composites with it. In short - simple.	2004-11-08

I always keep software current and am usually happy with each new version of Quicken but not with 2003.  While I am pretty happy with the new interface and have not noticed the ads that seem to annoy other reviewers, I am very concerned about critical bugs in the program.  Two examples:<br />1) In the check-writing window, you can't check the on-line payment box.  The only way I have discovered to create an on-line payment to a new payee is to create a register entry with &quot;send&quot; as the check number.  The check-writing window does work with existing on-line payees - it will automatically check the box when you enter the payee name.<br />2) In the check-writing window, if you highlight and control-d to delete a check you are asked to verify your intent.  If you tell the program to delete the check is not deleted.  If you were previously working in the underlying check register and a transaction is highlighted that transaction is deleted instead.  There is no way to recover the lost transaction.<br />Intuit has not fixed either bug in 2 updates to the program.  Intuit tech support is VERY poor and I am unwilling to spend $$ to be given answers like, &quot;Quicken does not support the current version of the Microsoft mouse driver.  Try to find an old version and install it.&quot;<br />I've been a loyal user of Quicken, QuickBooks and TurboTax for many (15+) years but I would try Money if I didn't have so much data loaded in Quicken.<br />If they ever fix these bugs I might change my review.	2002-11-28

I upgraded to the Pro version, but this turned out to be a waste of money. I first had to delete the old version of SM. Than SM wouldn't install because it sent a message that it was  not compatible with my Kaspersky Internet Security Suite. However, it gave the option of only installing those parts of SM not in conflict with Kaspersky. After installing the limited version, SM was still in conflict with Kaspersky. One or the other had to go. SM was, happily deleted. From other reviews, this Pro version of  System Mechanics appears to be in conflict with other internet security software. And the installation process is elongated and a pain.	2009-06-21

ACER creates four partitions on this notebook (and others, with two partitions \\"hidden\\"), most notably a C: drive for applications and a D: drive for data.  I, personally, have never liked multiple partitions and always have more apps than data.  So, after a few months, the app partition was filling and the data partition was not.  If I could have my way, I would have only ONE partition, a C: drive. For backup of this ACER, I use an external drive and Acronis True Image s/w.  This s/w saves a complete image of EVERYTHING on the drive, including ALL partitions.  I have used Acronis for several years on other computers.  Running Vista, things have changed so the old \\"Norton Partition Magic\\" doesn't work anymore.  Acronis Disk Director s/w claims to work with Vista so I purchased at a good price from an Amazon seller.  Desire was to increase the size of the C: drive while decreasing the size of the D:.  Left the other two ACER defined partitions alone because I was afraid to mess with them.  Before running Disk Director, created an image of the whole drive with Acronis True Image just in case.  Change in partititioning was successful although there were a few scarey moments when Acronis said it had to \\"repair\\" something.  Bottom line, Aconis Disk Director worked and this seller provided a better value for this s/w than some others.	2008-07-06

Entourage is particularly bad, sometimes I have to wait 3-4 minutes and I don't even have that many e-mails to handle. I have also dealt with more crashes than I would have expected. Mac software is supposed to be easy to use, though I must also say that software across the board has been more bloated and problematic than in the past (including Adobe and Apple software).    Other than the performance issue, it is not a bad upgrade: the look and feel is good, the software does what I need it to do and it helps my productivity.	2008-02-15

After reading the reviews for this product I admit I was a little concerned about both the quality of the product and the registration process. Both of these concerns were baseless. I'm a grad student at an accredited university in the United States and the process of registering and receiving a serial number took less than 3 min. the student edition does not come with the serial number. After receiving the product you must go to the registration page on their website and put in both the product number and an e-mail address ending in \\".edu\\". Next you select your institution from a pulldown menu of institutions in your state. I followed the instructions and received a serial number at my university e-mail in less than 30 seconds.  From the reviews and the price of the student version it was clear to me that I would want a higher-quality microphone. Along with this product I also ordered a Sennheiser ME-3 ev microphone and an Andrea USB adapter. Because the microphone is made to attach securely to a belt transmitter it does have a metal lock ring at the base of the plug. Some reviews suggested that this lock ring would have to be removed. Perhaps the construction of the microphone cable has changed but I was able to use the Sennheiser microphone plugged into the Andrea USB adapter without any modification.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking requires a four-minute test/learning session to create a profile for your voice. After this you can use it to dictate anything you would normally type. I am dictating this review. For $70 I don't mind having to buy a better microphone. This is a fantastic product.  After using the product for the past two days the only drawback is that I wished I purchased a wireless microphone. Being able to walk around and dictate at the same time would be, frankly, awesome.  Note: the Andrea USB adapter is a bulky dongle. I think the Andrea USB soundcard with array microphone has thesame adapter in a much smaller form factor bundled with a desktop microphone. For mobile users the smaller adapter combined with any microphone might be a better choice than the bulky dongle. I also read that the Yeti microphones also work well with Dragon.  to summarize, the student edition is a great value and easy to register if you have a \\".edu\\" address at an accredited university. You may want to upgrade the microphone.	2011-11-12

Windows 8 has nothing to offer me in that area except a gigantic middle finger.  Well, back at you, Microsoft.  If you can get any of your XP era games to run on 8, you're a genius.  No one I know can figure out how to do it.<br /><br />And this wouldn't be so bad if anyone was developing new versions of our favorite games for 8, but after an exhaustive amount of online research, I can't find any sign that anyone is.<br /><br />Hey Microsoft, just in case you hadn't noticed, there are a LOT of us middle aged guys out here with serious money to spend who LIKE complicated flight simulators, marching mechs, joystick and keyboard FPS games and civilization builders, and who find console games to be mostly beneath our intelligence level.  When you flip the bird at us the way you did with Windows 8, it's like Harley-Davidson saying, &#34;We are no longer interested in the customer who is a serious motorcycle enthusiast.&#34;<br /><br />And speaking of serious - did you actually test the metro interface with people and businesses who were doing anything more serious with a computer than just jacking around at home?<br /><br />I've been using Microsoft operating systems since 1985.  I still know DOS commands.  I rode out the ME farce and the Vista travesty, believing that Microsoft would learn from their mistakes.  Well, Microsoft, all I can say is that you had BETTER learn from this one and wake up and remember that there are millions of your customers who use desktop computers every day by choice, simply because a good desktop is still the ultimate in computing power and luxury.  And either Windows 9 is going to be a Cadillac, or I'm going to abandon you the way my father abandoned Detroit for BMW back in the 90s.<br /><br />Business.  Home Computing.  Gaming.  Backwards compatibility.  Internet.  Intuitive.  Logical.  Task-based design.  These are the things we truly care about in a desktop PC interface, and Windows 8 isn't it.  Come on, Microsoft.  Show us the right stuff again.	2013-02-01

I bought a subscription for 3 computers directly from McAfee.<br /><br />Initially my laptop's Internet connection was very fast, but by the second week it had slowed considerably. I ran scans but the McAfee screen always said \\"Your computer is secure - no action required.\\"<br /><br />Last night my machine was taken over by the malware Smart Fortress 2012, which completely disabled McAfee and prevented me from getting to the Internet to seek assistance. Using another computer I went to the McAfee site for information on how to deal with this attack.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this malware has apparently been making the rounds for over 2 months, there was no mention of it on the McAfee virus information page - and no solution to get rid of it except to subscribe to their $89.95 Virus Removal Service. Which then made me wonder what the heck was covered by the $80+ I spent to purchase this \\"Total Protection\\" in the first place!!<br /><br />After Googling I found instructions for dealing with it by downloading the free software \\"Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware\\", which combined with a system restore to an earlier saved version of Windows allowed me to recover control of my computer.<br /><br />When I ran Malwarebyte's software I discovered that my machine was infected with 3 trojans - none of which had been caught by McAfee. That probably explains the connection slowdown. So in other words, the free software was much more effective than the $80 subscription .... hmmmm.<br /><br />I suggest that the name \\"Total Protection\\" is a fraudulent misrepresentation.  I would rate the product zero stars if that was an option.	2012-04-28

It is not user friendly and their 37 minute tutorial is worthless. I hopped on YouTube and to my surprise all the user videos were gone. The reason is they no longer apply to the current software.

PC-cillin has once again done the impossible, improving an already great product without making rocket science out of it. There's no reason to spend more than you need to for an anti-virus program, firewall, and spam filter like McAfee and Norton want you too. They will also charge you just as much to renew your subscriptions alone at the end of the year, without offering any update on the product itself.

I was simply resubscribing each year, but this year they wouldn't let me -- no more support for NIS 2002.  I had to buy the new software.  I won't cry, I got my money's worth out of the old version, and I wanted to try out their new anti-spyware features anyway. <br /> <br />The install worked (almost) fine.  I uninstalled the old version first, a good procedure with any software, to keep your registry clean and avoid problems.  I also shut off the power to the broadband modem.  They don't tell you to do this, but your computer is wide open from the moment the old version is uninstalled until the new software is running.  A good precaution to take.  After the uninstall it tells you to restart Windows.  Did that, but when I put the new CD in it said I couldn't install yet because I didn't restart Windows.  Did that again, put the new CD in, same message.  Finally I powered the computer down and back on, and the install was happy after that.     <br /> <br />The product has worked like a champ.  There is a performance hit (as others here have commented) but I don't find it to be excessive on a 3GHz class Pentium.  When you consider everything it has to do while you surf, to expect otherwise would be to ask for miracles.   <br /> <br />The spyware detection works better than I expected.  I use Ad-aware and Spybot, both excellent freeware programs.  Norton detected some leftover garbage that those two missed.  That said, I will continue to use all three.  Spyware is especially difficult to accurately detect without false positives, more so than viruses, and a layered approach is good.  I have several small children that can never say no to any popup that offers a free game, and cleaning up all the spyware that comes with those free goodies has historically been a big challenge for me. <br /> <br />As for the criticism from some reviewers about difficulties uninstalling Norton: not to blow it off, but I would cut Norton some slack.  Many virus attacks go straight for the jugular -- the first thing they do is attempt to knock out the anti-virus software.  As a result Norton (and all other products) must walk a fine line between knowing when to gracefully step down and when to defend itself with every means in its arsenal.  Obviously they don't always get it perfect. <br /> <br />Two other pieces of unsolicited advice related to the topic:   <br /> <br />Stop using Outlook or Outlook Express for e-mail.  Server-based e-mail works just fine, and the e-mail has much less chance of infecting your computer.   <br /> <br />Second, consider switching your default browser to Firefox.  It's free and 100% compatible with Internet Explorer.  I've found it to be much more resistant to unintended spyware downloads. <br />	2006-02-03

I live in Thailand and have tried various phrase books, language media, as well as an English-Thai dictionary (which i still use for reference) and feel the need to give RossettaStone its just due. After reading the other reviews i could not understand what the problem was. RosettaStone does not use translation (which is the worst way to learn a new language!)but instead uses a \\"mothers tongue\\" or acquisition approach. This approach may take some getting used to but once the learner feels comfortable using the RosettaStone method one should see progress rather quickly. Yes Thai language is very different from English such as different sentence structures, lack of tenses, adjectives following a noun instead of preceeding a noun, a whole set of personal pronouns that change depending on the sex of the speaker, and then a whole seperate set for royalty, etc, etc. but this should not discourage a person from learning Thai. I will agree that to shell out the money for RossetaStone may not be practical if one is just visiting Thailand on holiday,  a phrase book would meet this need just fine since you probably wont get the tones right anyway but hey its Thailand and Thais are very tolerant. If you are planning on spending more than just a holiday,( like if you live in Thailand)then RossettaStone can be of benefit as well as taking a formal Thai language course. It's also important to keep in mind that the RosettaStone programs are not designed to learn a new language in a week which would be totally unrealistic but more like several months to a year.	2008-02-19

I have been using Nuance software since 2000 (when it was called ScanSoft) and I LOVE PDF Converter Pro 8.  It is less expensive than Abobe's full-price Acrobat but, to my knowledge, does almost everything that Acrobat does.  It lets you save any file or screen image as a PDF by printing the image to the Nuance PDF software \\"printer\\".  This doesn't work 100% of the time -- some web pages don't print well and sometimes the right margin is cut off, depending on the image and presumably page design.  (I use other screen capture software for those cases.)  A few functions that I particularly like are (1) the ability to extract selected pages from large PDF documents, (2) the ability to join separate PDF pages or documents into a single PDF file, (3) the ability to make PDF files searchable so that I can find specific terms and (4) the ability to convert PDF files to other formats.  I don't use all of the functions or the full power of the software, but it does what I need it to do.<br /><br />I recently got a notice that this has been replaced by the new and more powerful Nuance Power PDF software, but I am not in a hurry to change.	2014-04-30

First I tried to install on my computer at work.  It would not install, so I figured it was a conflict with other programs on this computer (Photoshop, Dreamweaver etc).  I found out later that it created a problem with one of the CD burners on this computer and it no longer recognizes cds.     I then tried to install it in my bosses computer since she does not have the large programs on hers. Install went though, but program did not recognize either of the two CD burners and I could not get it to work.  Found out later it caused a problem with BOTH CDs on her computer, neither work anymore.     I was told that perhaps the problem was because of the multiple CD's on these two computers so I Installed it on the office laptop since it only had one cd burner.  Installed just fine, actually got to use it, liked the program, I felt it would do what I needed.  Left computer on and went home for the day. Next day I come in to find blue and black lines across the screen of the laptop.  Rebooted, several times, still have blue and black lines.  Computer is now completely un-useable.      My boss ended up paying a computer guy $160 to come to our office to fix and restore all three computers that were in perfect running condition until I tried to install Roxio.

Amazingly enough, it installed flawlessly without a glitch.

Once again, no problems.  Imported my company data from Windows.....no problems, easy to accomplish.      I've since run through all the normal reports, imported and balanced bank statements, researched transactions, paid vendors, billed clients and emailed their invoices, and everything works fine for me.

They are nice topics and bright narrations that are very attractive.  But the vocabulary is not intermediate, and many words are rather rare.  The most important thing is that the explanations of the text were sloppy.  Just the general sense of the text was given rather than a word for word definition to help the reader learn. It was impossible in several occasions to get the correct definition of a word. And there were mistakes.  What should have been spelled as 'suit'ed, for example was rendered as 'sweet'.  Learner beware. <br />Maybe the editor does not know what a sloppy job was done.  They need to correct this. <br /> <br />	2007-04-07

UPDATE:  I found the out-of-the-box version of Quicken 2014 to be buggy and cumbersome to use. I was so frustrated with it after upgrading from Quicken 2011 that I gave it only two stars in my original review.  (See below.) I almost uninstalled it to go back to the previous version.<br /><br />I now have used Quicken 2014 I'm glad I didn't pull the plug on it. I stand by my original opinion that version R1 is terrible. However, Quicken has released a series of updates (the current one is R7) that seems to address everything that I complained about in the original version. With the R7 update the application now runs as smoothly as Quicken 2011 did. Now I can compare the features of the two versions on an apples-to-apples basis.<br /><br />The biggest change for me is the addition of cloud syncing and apps for iPhone and iPad that provide various current information about your accounts. The apps are very slick in appearance, but so far they're a little limited in functionality. I'd like to be able to record split transactions on the phone but this doesn't seem possible. However, you can view current budget status and chck the balances on selected accounts. I like having this.<br /><br />Otherwise, the changes are mostly cosmetic, which is to be expected given the maturity of the product. There are only so many new bells and whistles to add in each update.<br /><br />I gave Quicken 2014 five stars because the product is so incredibly useful. I honestly don't know how I would manage my finances without it.  With the numerous bugs eliminated, I'm very satisfied with the current version and would recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />One final note: The R1 version was so bad that (at least for me) it would not download updates without crashing. I had to get the updates manually. This isn't a big deal as they are easy to find online but it just highlights how bad the first release was. Don't give up. Once the updates are installed the product works like a charm.<br/><br />*******<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of Quicken since I started using it in 1993 and since that time, I have duly upgraded every few years. When I saw that Intuit was sunsetting my Quicken 2011, I purchased Quicken 2014.  I admit that I was a little concerned by the negative reviews, but I figured that Quicken is a mature product by an established company, so how bad could it be?<br /><br />I've used it for a week and I already hate it.  Why? Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Most of the time, my session ends suddenly with the program crashing.  No other version of Quicken that I've ever used has had this problem.  To me it's stunning that Intuit has made changes to what used to be a stable, well-conceived program that make it buggy and unstable.<br /><br />The program opens full-screen every time, regardless of how I resized it during the previous session.  This would be only a minor nuisance except that it renders very slowly, making the resizing at the start of each session a chore.  My system has a quad core Intel i7 running at 3.40 GHz with 8 GB of RAM so it's not exactly antiquated. Why does it render so jerkily? And why won't it save the settings I made in the prior session???<br /><br />Another defect I've found is that the registers won't accept a pasted entry.  I pay bills online, and in the past I would cut the confirmation number from the payment website and paste it into the check number block in the check register.  Quicken 2014 simply won't allow me to paste ANYTHING into and register entry, meaning that I now have to manually type oftentimes long confirmation numbers into the register.  WHAT THE HELL???<br /><br />I have no problem with Intuit forcing users to upgrade every few years.  Quicken is a valuable enough product that I'm happy to support it in this way.  My one requirement is that they DON'T MAKE THE NEW VERSION WORSE THAN THE PREVIOUS VERSION.<br /><br />Intuit seems to have botched this basic requirement.  After just a week of use, I'm seriously considering uninstalling Quicken 2014 and returning to Quicken 2011.	2014-05-03

First, to clean up digital pictures and second, to transfer ACVHD files from our [[ASIN:B00123WDR2 Sony HDR-SR12 10.2MP 120GB High Definition Hard Drive Handycam Camcorder with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]] to MPEG 4 format.  Adobe's Photoshop Elements is an excellent image editing package.  The \\"auto\\" correction capabilities are superb.  It effortlessly fixes red-eye and sharpens images like I've never seen before (and without creating pixilation or artifacts).  The Photoshop Elements user interface is easy to navigate and features are intuitive to use.  But on the other hand, the Premiere Elements 7 is hard to use and extremely slow to convert video files.  Worse, the software was unable to connect to our Sony HDR-SR12.  As a comparison, I used Sony's Picture Motion Browser (version 3.3.00.09300) software to transfer and edit HD video content.  This software was bundled free with the Sony HDR-SR12 and in many ways, exceeds Premiere Elements 7's ability to edit, compose, and compile video.  For example, Sony's Picture Motion Browser takes about 20 minutes on a dual core Intel processor (Vista SP2 32 bit) to compile 30 minutes of ACVHD 1080i content to a single DVD-RW disc.  It takes another 10 minutes to compile the same ACVHD content to MPEG2 files.  Premiere Elements 7 takes 3x longer to accomplish the same tasks.  In addition, Sony's Picture Motion Browser is much more intuitive to use than Premiere Elements 7.     I'm not a video editing enthusiast but I do appreciate software package that cam easily execute basic tasks like file conversion, device connections, and disc creation.  I recommend that you look at other video editing packages.  With regard to Photoshop Elements, you can purchase that separately and I have found it functional and easy to use.	2008-12-23

She brought all of her papers over and I did her return on TT.  She ended up getting alot more back and we even double checked the numbers.  I input my data on Tax Cut and my return came out lower too.  This is not the first time someone I know got a worse return using Tax Cut compared to Turbo Tax.

The program is easy to understand and use. Depending on the computer it might be slow, but on my good laptop it runs pretty fast. It was also very easy for me to import (not from a camera unfortunately) and export videos, the quality was good. The best part are the cool effects and the way you can easily manipulate the video length and speed, and even to a certain extent, the audio.    I have been using the program for years and it's worked on all systems, XP 32 bit, Vista 32 bit, and Windows 7 64 bit.    The only drawback it has is that it will occasionally crash for no reason, so I have to remember to save a lot. If it wasn't for this I would have given the program 4 stars.	2011-07-22

FAXSTF X is currently the only publisher of software so it's hard to compare it.<br />One of the most important things that the installation neglects to mention is don't install the software anywhere else except in the default location. Even though you have that option, if you do install in another directory or disk, the update will not recognize it and you'll have to delete and reinstall it again. And since FAXSTF gives itself root ownership, deleting it takes a little work. So install it into the default location.<br />The second thing is to make sure you download the most current version. The version on disk is for versions up to OS 10.1.2. If your use OS 10.1.3 or higher you must download the update from their site.<br />That said, the installation into the default directory is easy and painless. So it the update (which requires a re-boot of the machine), but must be downloaded .<br />Once the program is installed, faxing is easy - go to the printing center and add the modem as a printer. Now from any application, you simply select the fax as a printer and you're done.	2002-05-04

Far behind the times but still an industry standard Photoshop earns itself a big name, lots of 3rd party instruction manuals, and classes that are to be taken in order to learn the software. The amazing power of Photoshop is not only hidden from the average user--it is mistranslated into a reality where people use the software for building websites more than \\"Shopping\\" their Photos. Here are a few reasons you should avoid Photoshop: you are new to using a computer, you have thousands of digital photographs that need love and organization, your budget is tight, you want to remain sane. If you are rolling in cash and prepared to buy extra books and instructional aids be my guest and buy this software. You will be supporting Adobe's effort to get rich while doing absolutely nothing to help people who use their computer to handle photos. Is it that hard to hire some creative programmers and make a good user-interface? Adobe continues to bloat this software while making it increasingly difficult to use. I highly recommend trial versions before choosing to purchase this beastly mess.	2009-03-04

I don't see a lot of difference between v10 and v11.  The software works fine, but the response is a little slow.  My computer is fine and runs all other software without any problem, so I feel confident it is not my computer.  When I run Dragon 11, it seems to take a second or two before executing any commands.  This can be really frustrating.  When I use the MouseGrid, a command that lets you position your mouse cursor using a grid on the screen, I notice the latency the most.  It sometimes takes several seconds for the grids to appear.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I use Dragon is for writing screenplays.  I've been able to use this version with FinalDraft 8 with no problems.  I can create commands for my character names, so when I speak the character name it automatically adds the character callout and moves to the dialog line.  The latency is still an issue with FinalDraft, but with my carpal tunnel, it is a good option for bad days.	2011-12-15

It came in a cardboard envelope containing a paper envelope, which had a Microsoft product sticker (with product ID and key and all that).<br /><br />Windows 7 is now installed and activated on my home-built PC.  I ran into an interesting issue, for which I blame Microsoft's clunky installer.<br /><br />During installation I was prompted to enter my product key.  I did, and it come up as invalid.  My heart sank, but I figured i would see what the trouble was after finishing the install.<br /><br />I tried to go online to grab some software, and discovered that the installation did not install  a network driver.  I found this a bit puzzling, but perhaps there is no such thing as a base-level generic driver for all network cards.  I realized that the activation key failed because I had no network connection.<br /><br />Now, this is known to the installation process, so prompting for online activation when it knows there is no internet connection is just stupid.  Worse, if it fails to find an Internet connection it should report that, and not say the product key is invalid.<br /><br />Once I got the network  drivers copied over (via USB stick) and installed I was able to get on the Internet and activate with no trouble.	2015-04-22

I'm not an \\"I.T.\\" guy.  I don't have an \\"MS Certification.\\"  And for that matter, I'd never want one.  I am, however, an expert with the actual nuts and bolts of computer hardware... from \\"binary programming\\" to \\"assembly programming\\" to \\"BASIC\\" and \\"FORTRAN\\" and so forth, up to today's systems.  I've used every MS OS out there, and have used various UNIXes, as well as a variety of LINUXs (mainly along the \\"Red Hat\\" development tree), and was a bit of a BeOS enthusiast back in the day as well.    I currently use Vista(64) at work, WinXP Pro(both 32 and 64) on my work machine at home, WinXP Home on my laptop, and Win7(64) on my \\"Home Theater PC\\" in my living room.  I have several other machines sitting in various corners of the house, running various OSes.    Windows 7 is, essentially, a \\"service pack\\" to Windows Vista.  At it's core, it's not dissimilar to Vista at all.  There are a large number of \\"fixes\\" implemented, but they're no more different to Vista than WinXP SP2 was from the original release of WinXP.    That said... Windows 7 is a significant improvement in most areas over Vista.  It has a bit less \\"garbage\\" running in the background, but even in the most bare-bones configuration, the same code running in Vista or Win7 always runs slightly faster in Win7, it seems.  Not vastly so, but noticeably.  And the \\"garbage\\" (such as \\"user account control\\") is at least SOMEWHAT improved over what we had foisted on us with Vista.    Now, I'm running Win7 Ultimate (64) on my HTPC, as I said.  For that purpose... as a \\"media appliance\\" so to speak... one of the main new features of Win7 is TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL.  I'm talking about the idea of \\"libraries.\\"  I have an entire hard drive dedicated to my media storage (basically four main subdirectories, for audio, for video, for images, and for documents).  Each is a \\"library\\" and I can move items around and have them \\"tracked\\" and maintained, even if I move them from one location to another.  So, when I rip music, and I don't like where the files are stored, it's essentially completely painless to just relocate the entire directory structure for the ripped data... Win7's file system \\"automagically\\" corrects itself, and I don't have to rebuild all of my information within Media Center/Media Player.    As a \\"Media Center\\" OS, it's beautiful.  I couldn't be happier.    As a \\"game machine\\" OS, it's OK.  On the same hardware, I do see better performance in general than I did running XP on the same hardware, but that's probably due to 32-bit-versus-64-bit OS and optimized code for 64-bit.  And the \\"new\\" menu system works reasonably well here... since you normally want to run the same \\"app\\" repeatedly.    But, as a \\"full function computer system,\\" Win7 STINKS.  Why?  Because Microsoft decided to remove the \\"classic start menu.\\"    Lots, and I mean LOTS, of people are unhappy with this situation.  Because it's much more painful to navigate through the entire system (if you have a system with a ton of different applications and a significant degree of complexity of functionality installed) with only the \\"new and improved,\\" \\"for dummies\\" start menu.    The short form...  the \\"new\\" start menu (which isn't \\"new\\" at all... it was implemented in Vista and widely rejected by nearly everyone who actually WORKS with their machine) gives you a list of your \\"most recently run programs, instead of a tree-structure of EVERYTHING... which is what we really need.  You can run individual programs from the \\"command line\\" (or rather, the \\"search\\" line, now... which is far less intuitive for new users, I've found)... but you have to have the text run command memorized... it's just like being back in DOS in this regard, and is a massive step backwards.  And you get to see the few programs you've run most recently... which, I'm sure, is VERY useful if you only have six programs or so that you ever want to run.    I, on the other hand, prefer to have a \\"tree structure\\" taking me through functional groups of applications (I, personally, like to set up my applications in the following top-level functional categories - Accessories, Audio and Video, Communication, Productivity, Recreation, Reference, and Startup), to subcategories, to individual \\"application group\\" (typically with the main-level stuff, with \\"Docs and Links\\" and \\"Utilities\\" as subcategories for each main program group).  This works for me, and lets me EASILY navigate through my entire program structure... which includes about a THOUSAND individual \\"shortcuts\\" to various applications, application utilities, documents, and so forth) in mere instants.    It is POSSIBLE to do this with Windows 7... sort of.  There is an \\"all programs\\" link in the several-year-old (and, when first introduced in Vista, widely rejected!) \\"new\\" user interface, but you have to click it EVERY SINGLE TIME to get to that.  If Microsoft had allowed me to set up the \\"all programs\\" as the \\"default\\" Start Menu mode, I'd be happy.  But as it is, I simply have to go through many more mouse-clicks to do my normal, daily activities.    I've heard the typical adolescent \\"dood, you're old, get with it, this is TODAY, old man\\" comments from stupid punk children who seem to take pleasure in mocking those who prefer what they know, and which WORKS, in favor of that which DOESN'T WORK AS WELL.  But the bottom line is - the \\"new user interface\\" simply DOESN'T WORK AS WELL for those of us who actually WORK with our machines.    Microsoft really screwed up by removing the OPTION for this.  If it were a CHOICE, well...  people who really like the \\"new\\" (and \\"simplified\\") UI could use it, and people who prefer the earlier (and more functional) UI could use it, and everyone would be happy.  The main argument you'll see from the \\"MS fanboy kiddies\\" is about as intelligent as what I said above... \\"Dood, you're old, go away and die.\\"  No more depth than that.  Microsoft should have listened to their end-users...  a huge portion of whom DO NOT WANT the (for us) dramatically decreased usability that this \\"new\\" user interface forces upon us.    In my case, I've created my own work-around...  a simulation of the \\"classic start menu\\" structure...  as an applet pinned to the toolbar.  I use this almost exclusively, and pretty much ignore the \\"new\\" (and far less useful) start menu.  It wasn't difficult to accomplish, and it lets me use my computer as I... yes, ME, the actual USER... want to use it.  But, apparently, not as some bozos at Microsoft's \\"market underestimation\\" department (and plenty of smart-aleck 15-year-olds) want me to use it.    A few years ago, there was a \\"joke\\" version of Microsoft's motto...  the real motto was \\"Where do you want to go today?\\"  The \\"joke\\" version was \\"Where do we want you to go today?\\"  The upshot of this was that Microsoft was trying to FORCE the end-user to use the computer as Microsoft wanted them to, not as the user himself or herself wanted to.  With WinXP Service Pack 2, Microsoft learned their lesson...  and it was a fine operating system.    It seems that Microsoft is back to their old tricks again.  If you just want this OS as a \\"toy\\" OS (for, say, a Home Theater PC) this is a great choice.  But if you want to do serious work... I STRONGLY advise against buying it... at least until Microsoft decides to actually pay attention to what their customers tell them.  It took about two years with XP... I'm guessing it'll take about the same length of time with Windows 7.  So, most likely, \\"Windows 7 Service Pack 2\\" will be the one you'll want to buy.	2010-03-15

By all means if you are other than that, skip this review and go play with all the Linux variations until you find one you like, but this a general review from someone looking into Linux. I offered a review of Suse Linux and gave it five stars but the review was taken wrongly by maybe some in the Linux community who felt I underrated Linux because it should have been a Windows-word-free-review, but it wasn't, I had said \\"XP 2 + SUSE removable hard drive = ideal for learning UNIX\\", or maybe it was the UNIX community who felt bad about it because I am trying to comparing a cheap version of UNIX (Linux) to their expensive OS? Maybe it was just the brand (Suse) that got pounded. Who knows? Anyway this review will not have the W word again because I do not recommend mixing Slackware with another OS (Suse is better for that because of its more user-friendly installation), although you can do it with Slackware, I do not recommend Slackware for anyone new to Linux, or another OS, go dig for my Suse Linux review (you will find it easily - March 18, 2005 SUSE Linux OS product review), that is what you want to read and the Linux brand you want and is also about OS systems in general.

When you are happy that you understand how to install Suse and use Linux on your extra hard drive then it is time to install Slackware. How about that old PC? How about installing Slackware 10.1 on that? Slackware comes in 4 CDs. You should turn off your PC and boot from CD1. Set your system's boot configuration during start-up to boot from the CD. Now you MUST load the right kernel. There are loads to choose from. Find the right kernel that can find your hard drive hardware and you are in business. Slackware crudely does this and is often the top reason for Slackware installation failure. Then you must `cfdisk' and format a drive from a DOS type command prompt. If you can not `cfdisk' or issue any hardware commands that it is probably the wrong kernel you are using. Find the kernel on the CD (F2, F3 and then type 'x.s' where `x' is the kernel you need; listed), `cfdisk', after you have setup a boot partition (CD1 + CD takes up 1.3GB!!!! although less selection of software minimizes this but do not minimize! Slackware comes with Zipslack on CD4 for specialist mini-Linux installation), `setup' next and you are into the Slackware installation. Next is the `addswap' in the installation to include the Linux partition, `targets', `source' media, `install' configuration and you are ready to install. The package runs and asks you for CD2, install that and then the installation will end asking you to install a mouse, forget the network unless you are on one (you can install it later) but when you get to LILO you have a big choice here. If you install LILO then you are almost guaranteed 100% start up if installation was okay. If you do not then Linux may not read the hard drive right and fail to start Linux meaning `boot disk' is needed to get Linux running again and then install LILO so that LILO starts Linux for you.<br /><br />Login after start-up as the legendary `root' and the password you gave on installation. You will see a command prompt. This is what all your trouble was for. That command prompt is almost like UNIX using mostly UNIX commands, so immediately you can start learning UNIX (Like advanced DOS) commands. Cool. But type `startx' and you get a Linux variation of the UNIX xwindows, that runs as a graphical user interface with folders and copy and paste (just like that W word program) and you are free to explore that. Anyway click the K in the KDE menu below and click the `command prompt' icon, now type `xterm' and you got the command prompt window pop-up inside KDE, haha, now you can see how Linux is quite interesting, you can issue UNIX commands from this `bash xterminal'. Stick CD3 andCD4 in and copy them over (you will learn something called `mounting' here) and they contain extra software packages that you can use at a later date. CD3 has all the manuals (just learn Linux by the book, as per that book) so if you have CD3 in a PC next to the intended Linux installation machine it makes like easier although this is far from the simplest Linux to get running, it has the biggest Linux brand community as it was the first Linux brand, meaning development-wise this is Linux at its core, a community, without the bells and whistles of a big name software developer financing it, the purest Linux there is and if you are to learn computing then having a laptop with only this running is exactly what you need to be taught to pass all those software related exams. Linux is an all-in-one \\"learn me!\\" and for a few hours a week you will have most commands by heart. Read CD3 and go on from there. The key is to learning the Linux `box' this way until as such time as you can do everything from the `bash' xterminal window. Then go BUY yourself a fully privileged SHELL account from a UNIX provider, command that terminal from any PC of your choice, using the shell terminal to command any other legal terminal of your choice. That is what it is all about - Learning Global Commands and Systems.nd copy them over (you will learn something called `mounting' here) and they contain extra software packages that you can use at a later date.

I was using version 9 preferred at work (for medical dictations), and I just got version 10 preferred and imported my user files from my previous version. I use PREFERRED instead of MEDICAL, for obvious reasons: $$$. The software engine is the same and the vocabulary is there for the most part... it just doesn't prioritize the medical words when you first start using the software. In my case, the software added a bunch of words from my documents, that it didn't know previously. It took me about one hour to train each word separetely, including expressions such as \\"BID\\", \\"qHS\\", etc. After doing this the accuracy improved significantly, as it now prioritizes the words that I trained.    It took some effort, especially in the beginning, to correct the mistakes so it could learn not only from my style, but also for it to learn to prioritize medical words. A tip: when you correct a word, especially if you spell the new word, TRAIN that word. When I do that it will not make the mistake again.    As they state, version 10 might not work with EMR... but I don't know. I use mostly Access to generate my notes, and sometimes Word, so I wouldn't know. I bet you can use the dragon note pad and then cut-paste into your EMR.    Again... it takes a little bit of effort in the beginning to have it work well in the medical field. I'd say in one or 2 weeks - assuming you correct the mistakes and train the words - it should be pretty close, if not just as good as the medical version. That's not to say it would completely replace the medical version, especially if you need features such as saving the audio along with the document for someone else to review the dictations.    Macros are possible with Preferred 10 and are a great feature!!! For example, you can create a voice command that will generate a big \\"canned\\" chunk of text, when you say only a couple of words. I precede all of them with the word \\"macro\\", in order to be easier for me to access them in my brain. For example... when I say \\"Macro Muffin\\", the program types \\"The patient was instructed and encouraged to control his caloric intake, monitor his blood sugar closely, exercise at least 3 times a week, increase fiber intake and avoid foods that are rich in fats and carbohydrates.\\"    INSTALLATION: I tried installing it in my personal tablet PC... which I don't use very much for dictations, and I had the same \\"runtime C++\\" error that others mentioned. It might be because it runs Windows XP tablet edition and it has a Centrino 1GHz processor. At work I use a Pentium 4 with Xindows XP Professional, and 1GB of RAM and it installed very easily. I don't use the headset that came with the software, even though it's accepable. I got a Logitech USB desktop noise-cancelling microphone and it works great.    I hope this helps. I've been able to generate very complete notes with this software, and save a LOT of time.	2008-08-24

Undoubtedly, this will come across as an odd review.  I’m not a computer whiz, but am familiar with some of the basics.  Unable to afford a new computer, I try to maintain my home-office pc clean from a hardware- as well as software point of view.  I own an 8-year old Dell XPS400, running Windows 7 Ultra (satisfactorily.)  I only work with basic productivity software, without games or music software, and was not seeking to improve speed (content with the speed for my professional purposes.)  While I know enough commands to manually perform some rudimentary software maintenance, I try to supplement my limited knowledge and time with a utility software. Opted for this package largely based on Amazon reviews.  The software installed effortlessly and the software runs smoothly.  I run CCleaner regularly; the software appears to discern items to clean recurrently as well as Registry entries to fix (and ostensibly cleans respectively fixes them.)  Notably (for me), the CCleaner has not shown conflicts with other software I’m running, nor has it prevented anything from working (as some previous utility software packages showed.)  Noteworthy (in this day and age), the software is accessible to unlimited users!	2014-03-21

What I mean is that the Parallels \\"window\\" is a frame that looks back, from the Mac world you have now embraced wholeheartedly, to the great Windows-based application library.  Parallels wisely decided never to compete with the Mac experience.  It doesn't force the use to abandon the Mac environment to return to the days of Windows lore.  It's fast and extremely hardy.  It starts up well and handles the onboard devices correctly.<br /><br />One feature I like, when it comes to printer support, is that when Parallels is running and you try to plug and play with a USB-connected peripheral it will ask you whether you want that peripheral bound to the Mac world or the PC world during this active session.  That helps me keep track of things.<br /><br />The multi-tasking nature of MAC OS X is well-suited to the demands of the Parallels frame and it is possible to act in a dual capacity throughout a work session.  I have never had to call Parallels for support because everything it does appears to be intuitive.  Touchpad gestures may vary in a PC world but not enough to throw off a Mac user.  The delete key still works backwards.	2013-04-04

I like things simple and easy to understand. So far this is everything I have been looking for. I had absolutely no issues installing this software.  My laptop is not the latest model either, I bought it used for about $250 from a computer repair place down the street from me. At any rate from all the one star reviews I was very hesitant to purchase this thinking if all these people had issues I was bound to have them too. Everything went so smooth. After I installed all the software in the package there was instantly instructions available to explain things to me at my near 5 year old comprehension level. I had originally purchased Corel Video Studio Pro because of all the reviews with how easy using it was. Like I said when it comes to technology I am not a pro. I installed Corel and got SO frustrated with it I gave up. Corel's instructional videos and help SUCKED big time in my opinion. Avid was the COMPLETE opposite for me. Instructions were easy and plentiful, and I now know how to use it for what I want to do. The ironic thing here is that right after after I purchased this product Corel (the company I now want to kick right in it's privates for it's crappy instructions and making me feel I wasted my money) purchased Avid and now they are the same company. I hope Corel does not ruin it for me. Avid is great.	2012-08-11

I've done a number of film projects for school, some for my website, and others commercially.  Sonicfire is a perfect solution for me in doing such project with a tight budget.  I can worry about the video, and then slap together a very effective soundtrack using sonicfire at the end with very little fuss.  And it's comforting to be able to use Sonicfire and know that not only will it sound professional, but that you don't need to worry about the legal headaches that you'd have if you tried to aquire music through other means.<br /><br />The basic sonicfire package has some decent, general music in it, but you'll definitely need to buy more.  Sonicfire lets you browse their music library from their website, or, you can even do it right from inside Sonicfire itself.<br /><br />Sonicfire supports several different types of workflows.  The most basic usage is just simply browsing through the music in your sonicfire library, selecting the piece that you want, and exporting it out in a format you can use in your video editing program.  If you are doing a montage for example where you will be editing the video to the music, this is probably the easiest way to do it.  Another supported workflow is that you can import your video into sonicfire (as a reference), and then use Sonicfire's tools to build up a sountrack that perfectly matches the video.  You can even add \\"hits\\" in addition to music.  Then when you are done, you can export the entire sonicfire sountrack that you made into a single file (WAV for whatever) and import that into your video editor.<br /><br />Sonicfire has some neat features, like being able to select different variations of a piece of music (like adding/removing instruments from the mix).  Also, it lets you specify the length of clip that you need, and \\"chops\\" the song intelligently so that it seemlessly fills that time (without it feeling like it has prematurely ended).  I also like how you can very easily lower the volume of the mix for dialog etc.<br /><br />The only drawbacks I can think of are that managing the song libraries can be a chore when you need to re-install the software (when you upgrade to a new machine or re-install the OS etc).  This is especially problematic when you've purchased things online or from within Sonicfire itself.  The other drawback is that the software can be somewhat buggy at times (save often).  I've lost work due to crashes, but I've always been able to complete the project and been happy with the result.<br /><br />I definitely consider Sonicfire my \\"secret weapon\\" for film projects, and I even feel a little bad when competing against others who try to do it themselves (by hacking something together that they think sounds \\"real cool\\" in Garageband or having a friend do a few rifs on a guitar).  I definitely recommend it.e how you can very easily lower the volume of the mix for dialog etc.    The only drawbacks I can think of are that managing the song libraries can be a chore when you need to re-install the software (when you upgrade to a new machine or re-install the OS etc).

Given that, I must say this is a very nice all around package for the price.    For doing Layouts, Corel Draw was very easy to use.  Very intuitive and the tools needed were where I expected them to be (based on my Photoshop usage).  Being new at this program, I was able to layout a Poster in not much longer than it took me in Photoshop, and that with many years of experience with that product.    I also found that Corel Paint had the rest of the tools missing from from Draw that I was used to in Photoshop.  It was also pretty easy to use.    I don't know how many people actually need a raster to vector conversion program.  But I actually had a need for one.  PowerTrace was easy to use and did a good job.    For people with no experience with these kinds of products, the included tutorials will be a big help.    I don't know if I will make a total switch to Corel, though I will probably use it for complex layouts that I need to do.	2010-09-16

I purchased this one based on the \\"improve speed\\" of your computer features.  It was very easy to install, faster than older versions, I very much liked the look of the new 2008, and the scan seemed to be abit better than the older versions as well.  I did enjoy the feature of saving my logins.  I've not used that before.  However, all the good things were about to come to an end.  Yes my 2 laptops startup quicker than before, but their performance is slower than it used to be.  I was annoyed at how hard it was to turn off the Phishing filter.  I never use this feature.  After 10 mins of looking for and turning the option to off, it finally stuck.  Then I tried to find the Ad Blocking feature for webpages.  This was a wonderful feature in the older versions.  I could not find it.  I searched the support site and still could find nothing.  All I found were several references to download the Add-On pack with Parental Controls and AntiSpam.  Why this is an add-on in the first place I don't know.  After downloading and installing the add-on, I was still unable to block ads on webpages.  This is a major problem as I use Comcast Webmail.  After my email/webpage locking up 10 times in a row, I decided to stomach the cost, uninstalled 2008 and reinstalled 2006 and renewed my subscription.  This in itself turned into a hassle.  I had to get online Chat support from Symantec to get my renewal code validated.  When the whole process was done, I not only wasted money on 2008, had to buy a renewal subscription, spent way more time messing with my \\"protection\\" than I wanted.  I do not recommend this version of Norton to anyone.	2008-03-30

I've never been able to get the device river for the Dazzle 100 device to work for more than a few minutes before Studio either loses audio, loses audio and video, or stops seeing the device completely.  Pinnacle's tech support is very minimal so getting a definitive answer is impossible, but I think the problem is the device driver compatibility with Windows 64.  When I looked at the product specifications, it isn't clearly stated that Windows 7 64 bit is supported.  Because so many new computers are Windows 7 64, I think this counts as a very serious product defect.    Eventually I bought Avermedia's USB capture device, which works well, although I don't like the edit software as much.	2010-09-13

I did get frustrated with the speed of my system and items getting through in the past.  I even tried a couple different brands early last year.  I realized that I still liked Norton better and then upgraded to the NIS 2010.      Norton Internet Security 2010 was my favorite version of any NIS year.  My computer ran quicker and it seemed to find more problems than any of the previous versions.  I also liked that you could quickly view the computer % usage of the program.      I upgraded to 2011 several weeks ago.  It seems to slow down my system a little more than 2010 did.  It does give me a warning when I am running another program that is a space hog (tells me that Calibre is using a lot of memory -- when doing multiple conversions at one time).      While I like 2010 better, I like 2011 enough that I won't bother switching back.  Also, I always just get new software each year.  It seems cheaper than just paying the upgrade fee through Symantec's website.  I would recommend NIS 2011 to friends or family looking for a good internet security protection software.	2011-01-20

She unfortunately had problems with this program and the problem is translating the user-interface into something kids can understand. The 2D versions of Magic Artist followed the lead of programs like Kai's Power Tools by using image metaphors for the tools. Want to spray-paint your canvass? Pick up a can of spray paint. Want to have a crayon-like texture? Pick up a crayon. Alas, there are no metaphors which work well in 3D artistry so the buttons and tools in this program are not immediately intuitive. You REALLY have to read the manual to understand how to use the program. 3D Artist is also a bit of a resource hog. Even with 128MB of RAM, the program will stop us in the middle of a creation to tell us that we've run out of memory (Yikes!). You can also add only 1 color and 1 texture to each element of an object. You can color Mickey's head and his nose but you can't paint eyes on him or draw his face-mask. Animation of objects is also limited to a few sets of actions (spinning, hopping, zig-zagging, etc.). I should note that my daughter and I managed to deal with these problems and limitations because I've done 3D PC art before. My advice to you is to wait until Disney Interactive comes out with version 2 of this program.	2001-01-22

The title is a reference to the voice actress that plays Nancy Drew. Apparently she is withdrawing as her voice of the teen sleuth herself. Mind you, she's been the voice of Nancy since the very first game back in 1999. 32 games later, she's taking her leave...but more on that later!  When it comes to Nancy Drew games, I have played them all. My adventures have led me to solve tough puzzles, interrogate suspects, and catch some devious criminals. I guess you can call me a Nancy Drew Veteran. When playing Sea of Darkness (SEA), I decided to play through the entire game on Master Detective, AND without looking up any hints to solve puzzles. For the first time ever, I also “team played” this Nancy Drew game.  Nancy Drew's 32nd mystery takes her to Skipbrot, Iceland where she must work with a treasure hunter named Dagny to solve two mysteries:  1. Hunt down Heerlijkheid’s long lost treasure 2. Find Magnus, Dagny’s treasure hunting partner in crime  Since Magnus was trying to find the treasure himself before he went missing, Dagny assumes that the only way to find Magnus is to find the treasure, naturally.  When it comes to the characters in SEA, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how real and conflicted they all were:  Dagny’s past as a veteran treasure hunter gave her this passionate and vengeful thirst for success. Her snarky and sarcastic personality gave way to many satisfying conversations with her. Dagny also had some very controversial tricks up her sleeve, which really made me question her true intentions if she wanted the treasure for herself. When it comes to diversity in games, I typically don't mind it at all. As it turns out, there is a small mention of Dagny's partner preferences in the game, and I honestly have no problem with it whatsoever. I was actually really satisfied with the mention, mostly because it shows how progressive HeR Interactive has become as a company and it will ultimately do wonders for them in the end.  One of the biggest themes with Sea of Darkness is love and the many different forms that love can come in. Each character in the game had an inner conflict surrounding something to do with love, and Dagny was definitely part of that. Even Nancy herself had a conflict dealing with love with her own boyfriend!  Nancy Drew is a role model. She is the face of HeR Interactive. Think about it this way, what would Nancy do? Regardless of whatever Nancy believes, she would always respect people that had different view points that her. It promotes acceptance of others, which is a huge trait to have in the world.  *Anyways, I thought I'd get my two sense in because I'm baffled by the amount of negativity towards Dagny's character because of something so small and miniscule. Dagny's sexuality should not make up who she is as a character. She's a treasure hunter. And that's her role in the mystery. If that's how you really feel, then don't play Nancy Drew games anymore.  Next on the list is Gunnar, a regular at the pub in the hotel you are staying at. Gunnar is a glutton for comedic relief, especially all the interesting debacles that he gets himself into. I enjoyed every conversation that I had with this salty sailor. Sometimes, my friend and I would cry from laughter from the “hidden references” of some of the conversations that you can have with him. Aside from his unintentional comedic side is his tough and hot tempered exterior, which puts him in very accusatory situations, Gunnar also has secrets of his own…  Next on the suspect list is Soren, the head of the Skipbrot Culture Center and gift shop clerk. Soren’s the “black sheep” of the town of Skipbrot, even though he’s technically a native to Iceland who only lives 10 miles or so away from the town itself. This unfortunate technicality makes him the brunt of a lot of bullying and conflicts with the native townsfolk. I honestly felt bad for Soren. He seems like a genuinely good person, who with some bad luck, got into a tight situation. All of the issues he’s faced causes him to put up a rude and cold exterior, but that’s only because it’s his own defense mechanism after dealing with so much of the townsfolk.  Lastly, there’s Elisabet, ex-girlfriend of Magnus, and the rightful owner of the mysterious Heerlijkheid ship. She doesn’t know much about the treasure, but she is very convinced that Magnus went looking for it. Elisabet’s personality was really standoffish and rude; however, it made sense given her confusion surrounding Magnus’s disappearance. She was probably the most interesting character of all to talk to, mostly because of her “tight closed book” attitude. Slowly, the more you talk to her, she opens up, giving you more clues to solving the case.  SEA also has two phone friends to back Nancy up on the case. Ned returns as Nancy’s romantic boyfriend. Even though he didn’t do much to help with the case this time around, there was a really good and optional “side story” that I thought made the game more realistic and paved the way to HUGE character development for Ned himself.  Alex Trang is the other phone friend. Trang is an intern for the coast guard of Iceland. Her ability to work technical machinery remotely helps Nancy get “un-stuck” in a lot tight situations. I liked Trang’s “curious” intern personality. Even though her role was to help Nancy solve a puzzle, I felt that her character also satisfied the role of being that “curious and questioning” type. Even though we are Nancy Drew, we aren’t always inside Nancy’s head, and with Trang, it allowed us to see inside Nancy more and it was often humorous to hear Nancy be called a “weirdo” for her effortless theories.  I am doing little justice in describing how remarkable the characters in SEA were. HeR did a great job making them just the perfect amount of amiability, combinedwith the perfect amount of hostility. This made for the perfect recipe of a mystery, since I couldn’t really peg the culprit as easily as I thought I could. Also, a lot of Nancy Drew games that I’ve played in the past have had characters that didn’t seem like they played any role at all in the mystery. In SEA, every character was connected and had a role in the solving of the case.  The gameplay in SEA has some new and yet, subtle changes that I noticed that should definitely be mentioned first:  Puzzles now have directions on how to solve them! Back when I used to play past Nancy Drew games, I would get SO ANGRY when Nancy would mention how to solve the puzzle just once, and then the directions would disappear and I would be left to try to remember how to solve the puzzle myself. This led to looking up the walkthrough for clues or exploring the message boards. (Which led to spoilers). I am so very thankful that the puzzle directions section has been added to the notes. The puzzle directions doesn’t solve the puzzle at all, it simply says something like “Place the numbers so that each number is unique to each row and column.” Something simple and elegant and easy to reference just in case you forget, which was the case for me.  The “choose what Nancy says” conversation system is finally back. Players can now choose between the good and nice version of Nancy vs the snarky and sarcastic version of her. It was really cool being able to hop back and forth between these options. I really felt like I was in Nancy’s shoes. I really hope that HeR keeps this conversation system here. After all, this is what made the original games so great in the first place.  As far as the regular gameplay goes, it’s the same “run of the mill” typical Nancy Drew game. Players point and click to move, solve puzzles, use items, and interact with their environment. The puzzles in SEA were not as hard as the puzzles in the 31st game, Labyrinth of Lies. As I said before,I played SEA on Master Detective and also team played it. The longest time it would take me to solve one puzzle was about a day and a half on average. What really helped me solve the puzzles was drawing them out on paper and write out each of the steps. What also helped for me was talking out the puzzle with my partner and using trial and error to see if our combined logic worked. (It didn’t most of the time, but that’s what made the game more fun!) This game does have a lot of puzzles. My partner and I would solve one puzzle, only to come across another one a few moments later. I can see why a lot of people would get frustrated over this, especially since my partner and I got frustrated as well. The best way I think this could be fixed is by making puzzles that don't necessarily need to be “puzzles”. Sometimes putting an item into a machine is enough. HeR has this tendency to overcomplicate and overthink things when they don’t need to be puzzles. I also noticed a huge number of math and sudoku puzzles in this game. If you’re not a fan of minor calculations or sudoku in different forms, then I would suggest grabbing someone that does, or have a walkthrough ready in hand. There were a ton of moments when my partner and I would joke about not playing the game in “Amateur Detective” first because of the complexity of the puzzles.  When not trying to uncover the treasure or find Magnus, you could also spend your time at the pub learning Icelandic words or being a short order cook. Playing these mini-games earns you money (Kron) which lets you buy neat little souvenirs at the Culture Center gift shop. Although you can’t exactly do much with the souvenirs, you can earn an achievement for your efforts.  Nancy also has the ability to “go to bed” at her hotel, spanning the game out for more than a “one-night’s stay”. This made the game feel more realistic and I felt more in control of the plot progression. Sometimes, even if I didn’t have to, Iwould go to the hotel and sleep for the night just for fun. It’s the smallest things like that which really make all the difference in what sets apart a good Nancy Drew game to a great one.  The soundtrack in SEA was very pleasant to listen to. I was one of the lucky fans to buy the soundtrack before the game’s release, so I did have an idea of what it would sound like before playing the game. I have to say, “The Word I Couldn’t Keep” is a beautiful song. Before, during, and after I’ve played this game, I still find myself singing the words to this song. It has such a beautiful melody. It could borderline combat something you’d hear in a Disney film. The rest of the soundtrack fit the game perfectly.  No Nancy Drew games come without their faults, and there’s a few I have to address here: There were a few moments in Master Detective where I had no idea what to do next. This happened to be a part of the game where I needed to find a sequence of numbers that were scattered in different areas. One of the locations of the numbers was a place that I would’ve never guessed and it made me a little frustrated to have to look up the answer to that.  Sometimes, having the right materials before starting a puzzle was a bit confusing. Nancy would mention something like, “I need this and this.” but I wasn’t sure if I had the items in my inventory or not. It would’ve been more clear to maybe have the gear icon with a classic Nancy “Hmm” mummer be on puzzles that require more than one item to solve.  This game was very puzzle heavy. Not that puzzles are necessarily a bad thing, especially with games like Professor Layton on the market that advertise 100 puzzles in one game. I guess the point I’m trying to make here is that a lot of the puzzles in this game were way too similar. There was A LOT of sudoku and math puzzles, which could easily detour people that aren’t good at math to step away from the game easily. If HeR wants to keep the amount ofpuzzles that they have, they should at least make puzzles that are more different than previous ones. Either that or dumbing down puzzles that don’t need to be puzzles in the first place.  Overall, I had a great time with Sea of Darkness. This game took me a week and a half to beat, mostly due to my “team play” strategy this time around. The ending wrapped things up really nicely, and I would definitely play this one again in a heartbeat…but probably on Amateur Detective this time around. Honestly, I was very skeptical about SEA when I saw the teaser after Labyrinth of Lies. After playing SEA, however, I can say that I am very satisfied with the game. Another hit out of the park! Highly recommended to fans and newcomers to the series alike. Also a side note: The voice actress that plays Nancy Drew is making her departure after being the voice of Nancy for the past 32 games. In a way, this game definitely pays tribute to her leaving, and I can honestly say that the games will definitely feel different without her. I am looking forward to HeR’s next game with the new voice actress, but the original Nancy Drew voice will always have a place in my heart.	2015-05-28

Well let me start by saying that I was desperate.  I had Kaspersky Anti Virus 6.0, that didn't work, so, I tried all kinds of free anti-virus downloads that found viruses/trojans, etc, but the problems kept coming back, even after numerous scans, reboots, updates, uninstalls, etc.  I even tried 6.0 one last time to no avail.  So, I decided to try the Kaspersky free trial online, however the scan seemed to take forever and a day, so I said the heck with that, and I went out and bought this-Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0, for $63 at Walmart, what a rip off! (Some are selling it for $35 bucks here. I would've bought AntiVirus 7.0 but they didn't have it.)  Anyways, after installing the product and doing the updates, the actual scan took NO LESS THAN 5 HOURS to find 4 VIRUSES!  The problem was not immediately fixed after that either, I have had to manually delete some strange looking files and scan a couple more times.  One thing that you will want to do is change the scan settings so that it will pass over larger files and not take too long to scan each file or you will be waiting for a very long time.  It has been 3 days and I'm not sure if the problem is fixed, but now it seems ok.  So, eventually the product may work, but it may take some patience and some computer knowledge by the average user.  This appears to be the 2nd time that Kaspersky has saved my cpu from the brink of elimination, though I am not totally sure as of yet, but as for the others, Symantec is pretty good we use them at work, but McAfee is the worst of the worst, I would never in a million years give them another try.  They crashed my computer and essentially turned it into a non functinal piece of junk.	2008-03-11

Have been using Paint Shop Pro (PSP) as well as Photoshop for years.  Both have strengths and weaknesses.  PSP has a good built-in purple fringe remover and JPG artifact remover that Photoshop makes too difficult to quickly figure out in their version.  However, Corel is falling way behind on RAW conversions - frankly, PSP is getting pathetic at this compared to Photoshop or even Photoshop Elements, now.  The before and after preview windows in PSP are also far too small, and haven't been updated in years.  I'm a tech person and have no real issues using PSP but new users will find it harder to use I think then Photoshop Elements.  If you are an amateur photographer who only works with JPG images I think PSP is still a good deal, especially around the holidays when you can find it for under $50 on sale.  But if you're a bit more advanced and work with RAW images, head toward one of the Photoshop offerings.	2015-04-01

For my graphic editing needs I've had to load it back to my old XP operating system. Come on Adobe, get with the future and build a compatable version for those who really need it.	2007-12-18

When I got the opportunity to check out the Family Tree Maker I was excited, believing that finally I could put all of the information I'd gathered into one location and that it would look professional, While, for the most part, the program is great, I have a few issues.<br /><br />The biggest issue that it can be a bit tricky to figure out. The program can coordinate with Ancestry.com, and it can pull information directly from the site. It has a different format, however, and if you're already used to the Ancestry.com one, as I was, you may find yourself scratching your head for a little while trying to figure out how to utilize the program to it's fullest.<br /><br />It comes with a one-month free membership to Ancestry.com, BUT it's important to note that the one-month membership is only for the US records, not world-wide records. If you have a lot of family from foreign lands, for instance much of my family comes from Canada because we live so close to the border, you'll need to contact Ancestry to get them to upgrade your membership, and that may cost you.<br /><br />Overall I think it's a good program, if a bit tricky to figure out.	2012-03-15

The earliest versions of Photoshop Elements, years ago, were straightforward, intuitive and practical; they did the job. If only they'd still run on XP, Vista, Win7, Mac OSX...     Moreover, I'd expected to be able to install this not-inexpensive software on all my computers but learned via popup from Adobe that I'm limited to only two activations; that restriction wasn't stated anywhere in the product details on Amazon. (Adobe says I can deactivate an installation to enable activation on a different machine, but it's not clear whether I could then reverse that process to reactivate the other computer.)    Adding insult to injury, among the brochures packaged with the software is a $20-off pitch for Adobe's $70 Photo Essentials 3 plug-in, which promises to enable some exotic enhancements but also some pretty basic things I'd expected to be included in Photoshop Elements, e.g., if you buy the plug-in you can \\"improve the color, brightness and contrast of your photos in just a few clicks...\\" Gosh, really, I could do that? Thanks, Adobe, here's another $50! Not.	2011-03-11

It has many useful functions within it, many of which I have yet to explore, and too many to relate here in full.    Here is a taste of its functionality from my experiences ...    - Can have multiple windows (of varying sizes) open from various resources... For example: I often have the left half of my screen contain a window with Bible text, preferably NASB (though with 2 clicks of the mouse or arrow key I can change the Bible version), and the right half of my screen contain other resources on top of each other (I have now approx. 14 open windows now on the right half) ... maybe Pilgrim's Progress, maybe a few commentaries, maybe a book on evangelism (there are many interesting/useful references and books, both text and pictures/images within, by the way).    - The Lord Jesus Christ's words can be worthily distinguished in red (or other colors) in Bible text.    - Can highlight (or underline, or double-underline, etc.) text/verses in yellow color (or blue, or green, etc.) and apply notes (or notes) to them, and categorize/group those notes (the Note functionality is good, but I can think of some improvements ... like having sub-categories as in a computer's file directory).    - Has bookmark functionality too, though only 9 bookmarks max allowed.    - Can turn on and off Strong's Numbering in the Bible text by clicking a button in the toolbar (that I created ... I think that toolbar buttons can be custom created for almost every function).    - Can click the Strong's Numbers in the Bible text to see words' Greek or Hebrew definitions.    - Can 'link' my Bible text with another Bible version or even a commentary and have the two scroll together synced by verse.    - Can double-click on any word in a resource and have a 'Merriam-Webster's 10th Collegiate Dictionary' appear with the word's definition.    - Can click the back/forward buttons to return to previous places in a resource's text.    - One improvement that can be made to the software is to allow users to choose whether to read Bible text in 'paragraph' or 'individual verse' format. Currently, different versions of the Bible are set one with one format or another. I'd like to be able to choose.    - Has useful word search functionality allowing for logical search strings like 'Word and (Truth or Food)' in order to find matching text across all/some/one resource(s).    - Can right click on a Bible verse and have the software return 'every' reference/book in the software mentioning it.    - Can read a reference like Pilgrim's Progress, hover my mouse pointer over a Bible verse (or range of verses) mentioned in the text, and see a temporary popup window containing the Bible verse's text (that's a big one to me when reading the non-Bible resources). Can also click on those verses to go directly to the Bible text in your default Bible version.    - Apparently, the software also allows users to create 'Verb River' analyses of Bible text, though I haven't floated down that one, or others, yet.    Hope that gives you a sense for this product's functionality and worth. It really surpassed my expectations and I enjoy learning God Almighty's Word even more now, something that is priceless.

Wow, I wish I had read these other reviews before buying Instant Immersion Mandarin Chinese Deluxe.  I'm a beginner trying to learn the language because my girlfriend is Chinese.  But when I put the CD in, the autorun takes me to a screen where I can choose from several different lessons.  But there is no explanation as to what lesson to do first and when I browse around in the different lessons, I still don't get any clues about where I start.  Surely, as a biginner, I would think they would tell me \\"Do this lesson first\\", etc., but they don't.  I contacted their customer support and their only answer was \\"Do whatever one you want to do first\\"!!  Wow, that may work for someone experienced in Chinese, but for a total beginner like me I have no criteria or hints as to what one to choose first, and when I choose one at random, I'm lost in the lesson.  It's clear that's not the one to start with.  Help me!!  I want to learn Chinese, but clearly this is not the way.  Don't buy this software unless you already know Chinese somewhat (I'm basing that on other reveiws I read here).	2005-08-10

Corel Home Office came free with my HP mini notebook and at first it seemed like a perfect marriage. I used it to work on my first novel and during the writing itself it worked just fine. The interface is sleek and everything was easy to find.    But when it was time to start editing it choked. The closer to the beginning of the document I was the more it froze up as I typed. It also had problems if I saved it in Word and tried to open it in Corel Write. Worked great on small documents, but just can't handle the larger ones (the book is about 240 pages).

Picture was fine, but the sound only played from the notebook not the TV. Because it was being shown through the nScreen, there was a noticeable lag between the picture and the sound.  I used both the Slingbox application and the web based playback and had the same problem with both.

It allows the learner to learn naturally--by hearing over and over.  The adjective endings and idiomatic expressions become natural.  But, they also give the literal translations too, which is fun.  I can hear a native speaker pronounce a difficult word over and over and over.  I can listen to myself pronounce it too.

I previously used an older version of Mango which was a great help to me when I traveled to Germany. I learned lots of vocabulary.  However, the new version is really good in learning the difficult cases and adjective endings.  Even though I already know quite a bit of German, I find the review and the practice very helpful in keeping up with the language practice.  I am excited to know that there will soon be additional learning units.	2012-02-07

If you want to ruin your PC, use this, unless you have a PC that is not worth much and you've got nothing to lose, and are ready for all kinds of warnings coming up each 5 seconds, telling you that you need this and that, plus other offers.  It was given to me as a present and I regret ever using it, because it has created havoc in my computer.  My Norton keeps kicking in with all kinds of warnings, I had to delete from my programs 12 programs that came inclusive in WinCleaner that have nothing to do with cleaning anything, and still I have some adaware in the system that I cannot identify, and Norton is cleaning up for me.  Somehow it disabled my HPPhotosmartEssentials, and my CPU usage keeps rocketing for no known reason.  I'm sure there's something running on the background somewhere.

I wasn't aware that I'd have to subsequently download a humongous load of UPDATES after I had installed the out-dated contents of the DVD into my computer.      The maximum amount of time that I can be connected to the Internet before I have to re-establish my dial-up connection is 4 hours, and it takes a lot more time than 4 hours to download these UPDATES with a dial-up connection.  THIS IS AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM, because Webroot hasn't seen fit to provide a data manager, which would allow one to continue the download from whatever point it had been interrupted, due to a break in the Internet connection.  Webroot's UPDATES have to be successfully downloaded in one fell swoop, or the download fails.      When I emailed Webroot's technical support for a possible solution, I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE MY COMPUTER TO A PLACE WHERE I COULD ACCESS A BROADBAND CONNECTION, and to download the updates there.  Rather than hassling with the effort of trying to accomplish that, I kissed my $16.60 goodbye, and downloaded a reputable and well-known anti-virus product for free.  It took a little more than 9 hours to download that software - but it could be done, because that product has a built-in data manager.       If Webroot were a reputable company, they would inform their potential customers that their product IS NOT SUITABLE for anyone, who uses a dial-up ISP.	2011-04-30

[This company was bought up by Symantec in the late 1990s.] While this software was designed for Windows 3.1x it can be installed and used in Windows 95. The short 8.3file names remain. The software comes on four 1.44 floppy disks; be sure to make back-up copies on floppies, a hard drive, a ZIP disk, or a CD in case the data on the original disks goes bad afterwards. If this happens you won't be able to install it. The many manuals were simplified in future releases. They are mostly needed for reference.    The `Setup Guide' has the Product Registration Number needed for installation. The five chapters are: Overview, Preparing to Install or Upgrade WinFax, Installing WinFax, Troubleshooting, Getting Help. Appendix A has `Hardware/System Considerations'. There is an `Index' If you understand the COM - IRQ relationship you will have few problems. The internal fax/modem should be installed and turned on. You should disable hardware interrupt monitoring (IRQ) for your screen saver (After Dark 2.0, Windows 3.1). There are other warnings. Chapter 3 explains the Installation steps.    The `User's Guide' has fourteen chapters, a Glossary, Using WinFax With Your Mail System, and File Transfer Considerations. Chapter 14 contains Tutorials. Chapter 1 suggests two routes for learning: Scenic or Expressway. Chapter 3 tells about Sending Faxes, Chapter 4 about Receiving Faxes. You can view and annotate faxes (Chapter 5), or manage faxes and attachments (Chapter 6). Chapter 7 tells how to create and use phonebooks. Using Cover Pages is explained in Chapter 8. You can recognize and convert Faxes using OCR (Chapter 9). A Twain-compliant scanner can create images directly into WinFax PRO (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 explains how to use WinFax with other applications. You can change preferences inWinFax Setup (Chapter 12).    The `Cover Your Fax' manual shows the various cover sheets that are included for your use. You may customize them for your needs. [Your business may have a standard that you must use.]    I was a light user of this software. A one-page letter can contain more information that a conversation over the telephone given the same time. Businesses used fax machines for their simplicity and ease of use. Attachments to electronic mail compete with faxes, as they are stored after being sent. No `line busy' conditions.	2010-07-09

I installed the Business program but it could not import my personal return from last year.

Never having had either piano or keyboard lessons, I was apprehensive about learning to play my keyboard by myself through a software program.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Keyboard Coach has 25 individual lessons to choose from, starting with how to use the program. I really liked the easy way you are shown how to connect your keyboard to the computer to monitor the interactive lessons ( I was not looking forward to that part ).<br />The opening screen looks like a winding ribbon with multiple lessons. There are five rows on this ribbon with five lessons in each row. Click on a box on the ribbon to open that lesson. The lessons offer both written and video/sound clips. The clips can be viewed in a small window or full screen, and range from explaining how the plethora of buttons on my keyboard work,to observing correct finger placement to mimic -- and actually play a song.<br />Additional stuff includes what they call Cool Band Trax, or &quot;music missing the keyboard&quot; where you can practice for a real audition, or like me just pretend.  <br />If you own a keyboard collecting dust and you have never taken a lesson before, Keyboard Coach is going to make you feel like a star.	2003-01-09

I won't beat a dead horse on this issue, but I'll echo the general opinion that the online banking module in QuickBooks 2009 is TERRIBLE.  Did you know that since QuickBooks 2009 was released 6 months ago that Intuit has released SEVEN patches to fix their botched job?  That's how bad they screwed up.  The worst part is that even with all these patches, online banking still is nowhere as good as it was in previous versions.    Now that I've gotten the bad out of the way, I will say that the rest of QuickBooks 2009 is excellent.  Probably the most important change is that QuickBooks now can handle foreign currency transactions.  Most of the other changes are minor, but there have been some good improvements.    In summary, I give the product 0 stars for online banking and 5 stars for everything else.  So, the product gets an average of 3 stars.	2009-03-25

I DO NOT reccommend this game for young kids!! Not only is it awkward to play but it can become extremely tedious as well.<br />There were a few nice things in this version, you can fish and gather certain types of berries and herbs.

As a longtime user of Street Atlas since verion 3, I was looking forward to finally seeing some of the many map corrections I had submitted over the past couple of years.<br /><br />Much to my disappointment, absolutely none of them found their way into this 2012 version, despite Delorme's claim of \\"up-to-date maps and travel information.\\" Some of these corrections were interstate highway interchanges in my area that had undergone major renovations in the last 2 years. One fix was a mismapped interchange going back over 30 years! Google maps, Bing maps and Mapquest all have these fixes in their respective databases.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, there's a bug in the Custom Points of Interest (POI) feature that no longer allows you to choose which POI's to display. This worked in SA 2011, and I expect Delorme to fix it sometime soon, but it should never have been released with such a prominent bug.<br /><br />I've since returned to using SA 2011, which is perfectly adequate for my needs. The upgrade to 2012 Plus was not worth even the discounted upgrade price offered by Delorme to existing SA users.<br /><br />Delorme offers a 30-day, no questions asked return policy, but it's only for the purchase price, not the $5 s/h fee, and you have to pay for the return postage, too. In that respect, it would have been better to buy from Amazon, which would have paid for the return shipping and offered a complete refund for this less-than-perfect software package. But as of the date of this review, SA 2012 Plus is not yet available from AZ.	2012-02-24

It says that Learn to Speak German 8.1 is a 5 CD set, but I just got my order and it only comes with 4 CDs. The company selling it (NothingButSoftware.com) says that the 4 CD version is slightly newer, but has all the same stuff in it. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but will give another review if I find anything else out about it. <br /> <br />Since I have to give a rating, I'm just going to rate it the same as the average right now.	2005-03-17

This program allows users to plan out trips and add alternative routes much easier than its competition. You can also research locations for attractions, hotels, etc. unfortunately Microsoft only appears to have upgraded the points of interest and not added significant functionality to this latest round of software. Remember these maps do not export to all smart phones and GPS receivers. I wish Microsoft had better integrated Bing maps with this program.<br /><br />Overall it's a good program and handy tab on your computer.	2013-05-20

I just want to point out one limitation you should be aware of : Reason 2.5 does NOT allow audio recording and - as you can read on Propellerhead's homepage - version 3 will not allow it either. <br />In order to record (and mix) audio tracks associated with a Reason project, you'll need a Rewire compatible program (like newer versions of SONAR and Cubase) that will run Reason as a slave unit.  <br />However, the Rewire function is a part of the Reason package and it works nicely.

I had migrated several of my  computers to other products based on the bloated use of system resources that Mcaffee requires.   I purchased a Dell Laptop about 4 months ago and as it came with a Mcaffee 15 month license I left this machine with Mcaffee.   Recently this laptop became infected with the \\"Security Tool\\"  virus.   When I researched this virus on the Internet I find that it has been around for quite a while.  I called Mcaffee help desk to see how to proceed with the virus removal.  After explaining my problem I was switched from the Help Desk to a \\"subject expert\\" who turned out to be their sales department who then proceeded to try to sell me $140 worth of services to remove this virus.( By the way you can find out how to eliminate this virus for free on the Internet. )  Well you can imagine my reaction, here I was using their software which was supposed to protect me in the first place and they have the nerve to try to try to sell me additional services to remove something they should have protected me from in the first place. They also tried to sell me renewals for the licenses I had already stopped using.   Well I think I'll pass on continuing with Mcaffee and go with a company that stands behind its product and does not regard its \\"Help Desk\\" as part of its Sales Dept. .	2010-11-30

Adobe wouldn't give me a new license number for 8, so I HAD to buy 9.  8 was better.  9 has the same options but they take more clicks to find and the user is unable to bypass the opening screen and go directly to edit as in 8.  Adobe has adopted the MS idea of shoving options at all users and not allowing experienced ones to go easily to their favorite methods of editing photos.  I wish they'd allow users to completely bypass the Organizer thing. I use Windows Explorer folders and my own naming conventions to organize my photos and other software purchased when I was still using Elements 1 for setting up slideshows and adding captions.  Adobe was late to this game and I see no reason to change to their Organization and web site to upload, archive and share photos.	2011-08-31

I just finished Level 1.  There is method to Rosetta Stone's madness.  But figuring out their method can drive you to madness.  They want you to look at a picture, most of the time a very obscure picture, (worth 1,000 words?) and find the words they are thinking of.  Sometimes it's obvious, a lot of the time it is NOT!    I wasn't a complete beginner at Spanish so it was less frustrating for me.  A friend, who had zero Spanish experience, began the course at the same time and is very frustrated with it for the above reason.    It would be nice if there were something that said, \\"This is what we want you to get from this section...\\" But there is not, you are on your own to figure out their method.  Sometimes, like one reviewer said, you get so frustrated that you want to throw the computer across the room.    I get Rosetta Stone for free from my employer, so I'm going to do all five levels but I'm supplimenting it with as much different material as I can.  I bought several books of the, \\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" series written by Dorothy Richmond.  I bought; \\"Basic Spanish,\\" \\"Spanish Vocabulary,\\" \\"Spanish Verb Tenses,\\" \\"Spanish Pronouns and prepositions.\\"  All are well reviewed here on Amazon and I have REALLY liked them and they are INEXPENSIVE!  Several times I've been reading from one of them and, \\"OH, that's what Rosetta Stone is doing!\\" went through my mind.  Another suppliment I'm using is the video novela, \\"Destinos!\\"  It's a 50 episode (30 minutes each) Spanish novela by the ?University of Chicago?, it's free to watch online and you can find it at a library on DVD  ( [...] ) I'm just listening to the episodes to help my comprehension.	2010-07-15

I can see how this would be useful for those who do not understand the process, but to be honest if you do not understand the process then you are better off not owning an mp3 player. You need to learn the skills for the devices you want to operate.<br /><br />Now they claim it takes about 7mins to rip a CD. This was true about two or three years ago, but right now a decent modern computer can rip a CD in 3mins easy. You get a SATA CD Drive and life is good.<br /><br />There are those who talk about their huge CD collection, and how it would take forever to rip it and so on. My CD collection is well over 300 CDs right now, and every one of them is ripped into my computer. Whenever I buy a new CD I immediately rip it, considering I don't really even own a CD player anymore, just my MP3 players (I think I still have a boombox with a CD player). So what if it takes a bit of time to rip the whole collection, I just start it going and watch some TV or read a book, and change out CDs as needed. The modern MP3 ripping software automatically looks up all the album info (sometimes you have to double check it, but not often) and toss in album art and all that crap.<br /><br />Basically, this service is charging you 99 cents per CD to do something that you can do just fine on your own. Why spend money for this?  Heck, you are looking at a time frame of probably two weeks easy to get the CDs copied, rather than just doing it yourself in a day.	2008-07-21

Microsoft has gone well beyond fixing the annoyances of Vista.  This OS is the best out there, period.  Vista's poor reception obviously made them work twice as hard this time around.  It shows.    I upgraded my vista on a Dell Inspiron 1318 Laptop, 32-bit, Core 2 duo 2.0, 3 Gig.  Install took a few hours, but went off without a hitch.  I just let it grind away on it's own- you don't have to watch it.    Everything from the internet to Photoshop runs faster.  Everything!  It's fantastic. ReadyBoost works well too (didn't work for me in vista).  Start ups and wake ups are snappy.    The aero snap works well, the new taskbar is much more functional, and the file indexing system means no more drawn-out searches.     Best Windows yet.	2009-10-30

It is based more on the &quot;NT&quot; architecture than win9X.  My biggest gripe is that a lot of games will not play on it that would play on 95/98/ME.  Also if you are an advanced user, many of the &quot;user friendly enhancements&quot; seem awkward, and frustrating.  It takes a good hour or so to go through and make the GUI act like NT or Win2000, and not ask you &quot;are you sure you want to do this?&quot; 1,000,000 times.<br />If you are a regular everyday user, you will probably like it, but if you are more advanced and know your way around Windows you may find XP annoying.	2002-05-16

This is my fifth year of using NIS to protect my home computer and laptop. With the noticeable improvements last version, Norton came back with a bang. While NIS2010 still has some flaws, the good trend seems to continue this year as well.    Installation: Installation was very quick similar to NIS2009. It does require a restart which seems to be the case for most virus protection software. Norton for some reason wants us to download and install parental control separately. just a hazel. If you are an existing NIS user you can upgrade from Norton's upgrade website before deciding to purchase the new version. The upgrade will retain your 2009 subscription and your license will be retained as well. NOTE: If you install from CD, your old license will be over written.    Performance: I don't think NIS2010 is a resource hog. Norton also has performance meters where you can check how much of the system resources are being used by Norton. It seems NIS 2010 uses most system resources only during a complete scan. NIS2010 upgrade virus signatures on the background during idle time just like NIS2009. So you dont feel that it exists. Quick scans during idle times also seem to be pretty quick. I havent noticed any loss of performance in the one week that I have been using NIs2010.    Virus protection: Based on tests by PC world and CNET Norton is only behind the not well known G-DATA internet security in virus detection. I havent used G-DATA so I cant compare them. However, NIS has gotten better at malware detection. It did detect a number of malware that adaware and other security software that I use (e.g. Advanced system care). NIS2009 missed a number of these malware.    Network protection: Although NIS claims that when NIS is installed in all PCs on your network, it can detect and keep a trusted network, it has not worked for me. NIS detected my skype phone (ofcourse didn't protect it), but didn't detect my other PC on the network that also has NIS2010 installed. I am not sure if this 'trust' is of any use to me anyway.    Internet security: Norton identified websites that you visit (amazon, bank and ccard websites for example) as trusted ones based on IP address and other data. so you can be safe you are not entering your password on a phishing website. It is very handy for me. I always look for the 'trusted' sign from both Firefox and NIS before entering my passwords.    Password manager: I dont know if I will trust NIS to be my password manager. You need just one password for Norton and it can manage your other passwords and form filling information. However, it seems to be easy to break in to NIS to obtain the password manager's password list. Although the hacker needs physical access to your computer to do this, it is a concern if your laptop gets stolen for example. NIS2010 offers to have the password manager's list reside on removable media which is a somewhat safer alternative. Norton safe search which identifies safe websites on your serach list is also helpful, but google can do this as well.    Over all, it is a good virus protection for your PC, checks files on the fly, can scan emails and attachemnts, IM text and links. Not very good for password management and parental control.	2009-10-01

This is a feature rich update of the Office:Mac program. The user interface is elegant, and very Mac-friendly.<br />Initially I had some difficulties with the program - first, it would take a very long time (upwards of 20 minutes!) to launch, and the program had real problems with Font menus. A few simple tweaks to Word, and to my font management software solved these issues. Now all my Office:Mac 2008 applications open swiftly and work smoothly.<br />A problem I had with the 2004 version of Word in particular was that there was a slight lag between keystroke and monitor update, so my typing was always a few words ahead of what was visible on my screen. With the '08 version, this has gone away.<br />If there is a flaw in the program, it would actually have to be that the new Mac-like interface has changed where tools and features are located, so I find myself having to learn my way around the program all over again. I hate to say it but I miss the old menu and toolbar structure.<br />Otherwise, the program works beautifully.<br />I'd update the star rating here to 4 1/2 if I could - can't do that when editing reviews, sorry.	2009-07-05

Just a li'l background on this user: I'm a college grad in the field of computer engineering, the last 7 of 8 years working have been spent in the I.T. field, and I fix and build computers whenever I'm not \\"working\\". I'd personally consider my experience with computers in the upper nerd category, just shy of total geek.  <br /> <br />I've used all the antivirus suites out there. Zone Alarm? Didn't like it. It was way too intrusive. The popups asking for permission that everyone whines about in Vista...were far more ridiculous in Zone Alarm. Norton? Liked it. Avid user for about 5 years, until i re-upped my sub by buying (yes..buying) a new version...and just 2-month into it, the key magically became \\"corrupt\\" and I couldn't use the program. I could either uninstall and purchase a new one, or call them and get a new activation key. Either way, I was out, at minimum, $70. McAfee? Okay. This one I hadn't used in home, only my last job. We built 300 computers for our stores, stretching across 3 states. Of those 300 computers, all had McAfee, and after just one week, 180 of them had viruses. So that's no good. Trend Micro PC Cillin? Probably my favorite out of this bunch. Downloads updates just fine, and updates to the software. You can purchase up to three years of the program (for instance, the 2006, 2007, and 2008) versions, you can have it on up to 3 PCs. What's not to love? Well...it's nearly impossible to configure on Xbox Live. And when you turn the firewall off to use Windows Firewall, you constantly get an error message saying you're not fully protected.  <br /> <br />Okay, so now we get to why you're really reading this. My views on OneCare. <br />But first, one little thought to keep in mind here. I'm not one of those who uses Vista (tho I do), OneCare, plays on Xbox, but still talks about how greedy [M$] is.  <br /> <br />Windows OneCare is a good little program. Looking at it, sitting there, open, on your desktop, you'd think this program was designed for your average computer user who has no clue what a \\"virus\\" or \\"spyware\\" is. Once you get a little further into it, it's actually a neat little program. It's VERY easy to configure, unlike a lot of the more popular (both in retail, and just with fellow nerds) software out there. Making backups is a snap. The virus/spyware scans are quick. The tuneups are efficient. One thing I like so far is how insanely easy it is to schedule all of these things. The fact that it works hand in hand with Windows firewall, which not so coincidentally, immediately recognizes and allows the ol' xbox 360..takes a lot of hassle out of the equation.  <br /> <br />One other feature I really like is one of the simplest. The logo with the \\"1\\" in the quick launch toolbar by the system clock. If all is well, and you've done everything you can...it stays green. If you hadn't made a backup in a while, or some other thing's wrong, it'll turn yellow. Lord only knows what red is. Probably a virus. But it's really cool to be able to tell at a glance if you need to fix something. <br /> <br />I've only been using this program for about 48 hours, but as it is right now. I really, really like the program. It's not a resource hog. It's easy to install, tweak, and schedule. I have no real dislikes about the program.  I guess the only one I really had...when I first installed Vista (home premium, 32-bit), OneCare didn't want to install as well, which seemed odd. Two days later, it installed just fine, and has been great ever since. After I get some more time with it, I'll follow up. <br /> <br />	2007-05-18

Though I wouldn't play it until after the fall of the Berlin Wall, this game was for me a very late 1980's affair, a relic of the cold-war.  Based on Testors/Italieri's conceptual design model kit of the then-still-classified \\"stealth fighter\\", the game allowed you to fly missions in hotspots all over the world: Iran, Cuba, Libya (it wasn't enough to hate Khaddafy, the game ridicules Libya by giving it the easisest missions) and scariest of all, the Soviets' arctic redoubt of Murmansk.  The latter was already well known for anybody who'd read either \\"Hunt for Red October\\" or \\"Red Storm Rising\\".  For those of us still in HS, \\"F-19\\" was the closest we'd get (or want to get) to the epic action of those books or the host of copycats. <br /> <br />The thrill of F-19, and what makes it a fun idea today, is that it was the sim that most effectively dealt with the one-man-air force conceit of pre-\\"Falcon 3.0\\" sims, in which your jet does the work that would occupy an entire air wing.  Here, you use your limited invisibility to sneak into enemy airspace, locate specific targets and destroy them.  You can't rely on wingmen because solitude is part of your elusiveness.  You're on your own, but this sim doesn't correspondingly make things easy for you, and once you've crossed the line between myaerospace and hell, the difference is palpable. <br /> <br />F-19 not only offers thousands of square miles of busy and unhospitable (if poorly modeled) terrain, but a host of counter-air and ground-attack weapons with distinctive attack profiles.  HUD symbiology and weapon effectiveness are distinct.  Use the wrong weapon on a target and even the best marksmanship will prove useless. <br /> <br />Ofcourse all this simming will require a fast and modern computer! <br /> <br />Hahhh.  I;m sorry about that, but I had to do that.  Fats computer, get it? <br /> <br />Anyway, if you've got a working 486, or even a 386, you can hook it up to one of those CRT's that people are leaving on theircurbs for special pick up.

I bought full verisons of both. The only time I use the others is after I have used Pageplus and need to do a small resize or to export in a different file.  I don't have to spend time trying to find a book or a tutorial on how to work the darn thing. PLUS I'm a graphic designer and a mom. I don't have time to spend hours make a simple art card. Instead with page plus it only takes me 10 minutes! With photoshop and paint shop pro it takes me about 30 minutes to make one design..<br />If you hated it.. it's because you prefer photoshop's and paint shop pro's features. This is a better option for those who have a very small budget. To be a graphic designers doesn't require you to spend a ton of money on software and books.. it means designing while having a great time. Being stress free is a way of life and this software makes it super easy.	2010-03-24

Turns out there is a new product that will do this instead. You can google Inesoft Cash Organizer.     For anyone who is curious, here is my pocket quicken and windows 7 story:     I had pocket quicken 2.5 on my computer and pda. My computer died. I could not find the pocket quicken disk to load on my new computer (having just recently seen it. I have a 2 year old and things just disappear.) I couldn't find a 2.5 version to buy so got a 2.0 from amazon.     My new computer was windows 7 home which is not compatible with activesync. So I had to buy the professional upgrade to get Win XP mode that would work with activesync. Except I could not get the virtual pc to load. Many hours with microsoft tech support to find out all I needed to do was go in bios and turn on my virtual technology field.     Then my pda would not sync with activesync. I had a microsoft tech support person tell me it was not possible for xp mode to work with activesync. I did not believe him so kept making phone calls to MS tech support. Finally found \\"Earl\\" who showed me the menu at the top of xp mode that says USB. All I had to do was click in there and attach my pda and suddenly my pda was syncing with my computer.     Then came several hours of trying to figure out why pocket quicken would not sync with my computer. I ended up at mobilitysite forum and found out pocket quicken 2.0 is not compatible with windows mobile 5. Then I found a thread called \\"Pocket Quicken help???\\" with the link to downloading pocket quicken 2.2. I downloaded it and my pda and computer synced. I only have 2 weeks to get an activation code. However, I was able to see my accounts on my pda!!!!!     I have emailed landware. Hopefully I can get an activation code from them and all will be well. If not, I will be bummed. I have spent over $100 and many hours of time just to get pocket quicken to work. How sad if it doesn't.(And with two little kids underfoot, who knows what my quicken accounts will look like. Actually, I know. Between the birth of my son and getting pocket quicken my previously flawless, beautiful accounts were terrible. I hope that fate does not await me again.)	2010-11-18

Well, what can you say... live and learn I suppose. Bottom-line, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is a big disappointment for me. <br />I recently purchases Elements 3.0 and read the upgrade benefits in Elements 4.0 on the Adobe website. I thought, great 16-bit image support, facial color restoration, improved this improved that. <br />At the end of the day, I uninstalled Elements 4.0 and went back to 3.0 <br />Why? I take a lot of photos and keep them in the highest resolution format I can. I generally use TIFF format. I like to convert them into JPG format for distribution on CD/DVD or on the web.  <br />In Photoshop Elements 3.0 there was a file browser and I could easily select 2 or more photos and edit them or convert them. This file browser is gone in 4.0 and while it was poorly designed in 3.0 it worked once you figured out its annoyances.  <br />But the 4.0 product in practice doesn't seem to handle 16-bit files any differently than the 3.0 version. What's more, it tends to blow up on my system when converting to JPG. In fact some of the very same files I converted with 3.0 to JPG are causing 4.0 to blow up.  <br />I would speculate that PhotoShop Elements 4.0, which is only available under Windows for now, will be thoroughly tested by the time the Mac OS X version comes out later this year. Too bad Windows users have to be the beta testers and funding providers for Adobe's PhotoShop Elements 4.0 <br />If you already own PhotoShop Elements 2.0 or 3.0 don't bother with this upgrade. If you own nether, I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Suite. It is easier to use and ironically seems to work better.	2005-10-18

A drill will show you a picture of an apple, and you'll see the word spelled out while a narrator gives the pronunciation. At various points in the drills, you will have the chance to read the Japanese word for apple, use your logic and language skills to pick the picture for apple after hearing the word in Japanese, and more. Its target audience is the self-motivated learner who's serious about learning and mastering basic Japanese over a 1-2 year period. Anyone looking for a quick and useful phrases for a short visit to Japan should use the Rosetta Stone Explorer or Traveller programs instead of this set. That said, using the Rosetta Stone is a lot cheaper than a plane ticket to Japan, or the tuition fees at intense summer Japanese courses at various universities around the US. If you master all the drills and vocabulary in the program, you will be well equipped to go to Japan, and to continue learning the language in an immersion environment.<br />The student who has headphones and microphone attached to his or her PC will be able to take advantage of all the listening, reading, speaking and writing drills in the program. Users can switch back and forth between the romanized, hiragana and kanji scripts.<br />Your Japanese teacher may not have the time (or patience) to give you individualized, repetitive drills. That's not a problem with this program - you can practice all you like and the program will never get tired of you! As such, the program is a good supplement for people formally enrolled in a class.<br />For the student who dislikes the immersion approach and prefers to learn Japanese scripts and grammar before tackling any listening or reading, I recommend the Power Japanese and Kanji Moments programs from Bayware software.<br />Once you have completed the Rosetta Stone programs, you will still need some formal study of grammar, but this program covers basic principles like thesubject-object-verb order characteristic of Japanese, and basic verb forms.<br />I used the online version of RS Japanese, and was extremely happy with it, but only because I have very high-speed internet access. Once my use license expired, I could no longer access the programs. If I had the CDs, I'd always be able to refer to the program later. Take your pick based on your own personal convenience.<br />I liked my RS Japanese experience so much, that I took the plunge and bought the Level 1 Korean edition on CD.	2002-12-07

It is quick and easy, and if you just want to make a document into a PDF, that's still your best bet.<br />(3) I do know that free options are out there to do many of the things this product does, but I'm a little hesitant about freeware. I've been burned by viruses and processing issues in the past, and I trust Adobe products.<br /><br />Installation: Easy and quick. I did have some programs running that I had to close, but that's par for the course whenever you install new programs.<br /><br />Creating forms: This was the primary reason I was interested in this product, and it definitely delivers. I have used it for professional use (for my husband's business) and ministry use.<br /><br />Merging items into a PDF: Pretty seamless. Makes for a more professional product than sending several files separately (which I will still do at times, but I like the option to do whatever makes the most sense in the circumstance).<br /><br />Easy of use: Perhaps my familiarity with other Adobe products helped me, but I didn't find it as problematic or the learning curve as steep as other reviewers. I definitely have had to use the powers of Google to figure out a couple of actions, but it didn't take much time or effort to do so. I do think both Acrobat Professional and CS5 products could be a little more user-friendly, but the interface and usability - while not a strength - were just fine for me.<br /><br />Other pros: I like the portfolio set-up and the text recognition.<br /><br />One not-so-important comment: It comes in a much larger box than necessary. I don't know if it's supposed to be psychological (as in, \\"I'm paying this much, so I deserve to get more than a dinky jewel case\\"), but it was overkill.	2011-06-21

The sound in particular is fantastic: lots of environmental effects like sloshing water, rain, creaking floors, etc., and excellent voice acting by the antagonist: he has a lot of lines and he delivers them solidly with enough affectation that you really get some sense of the character's personality.  The graphics are good - not outstanding, but not a detriment to the game either.  I really enjoyed the few surprises the developers put in when you mouse over something and it breaks - the antagonist's comments when this happens are amusing.  I liked the sheer number of different rooms/scenes in the game.  It was fun to explore through them all.  Unfortunately there is no fast travel using the map, so you have to backtrack quite a bit, but MagicIndie did a good job of zoning things so that after certain points you do not have to go back into earlier sections of the game.  The hidden object scenes are pretty standard - nothing special.  The puzzles vary from too easy to somewhat challenging.  The story is a bit trite (save your girlfriend from the psychopath) but its execution is well done and I enjoyed the twisted sense of beauty the antagonist portrays with his \\"art\\".<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with the game and highly recommend it.	2013-04-17

After all the negative reviews from folks who did not have the hardware to run this game, I thought it would be helpful to have a review from somebody who has actually played it for a while.  In a nutshell, this game is awesome--both for adults and kids.  The graphics and gameplay are a huge improvement over versions 1.0 and 1.5, which themselves were fantastic games.  My 7-year-old son and I are addicts already.    I have collected some observations about the game that I hope will be helpful to prospective purchasers.    NATURE OF THE GAME    Version 2.0 follows the same basic format as the earlier incarnations of Crazy Machines.  You are given a challenge (e.g., put this ball in that basket) and provided a set of elements (e.g., gears, belts, motors, explosives, ramps) to complete the task by building Rube Goldberg--or, for the modern generation, Wallace and Gromit--contraptions.    HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS    Other reviewers were right that this game demands a lot from system hardware.  But that is a double-edged sword.  On one hand, users with older, slower machines, will not be able to play it.  On the other hand, users with newer computers will enjoy dramatically improved graphics and physics modeling (see below).    My computer runs CM2 just fine.  I have a year-and-a-half old Dell with a Core2Duo 1.9 GHz.  Not a screaming powerhouse of a computer, by any measure.  I do, however, have a new graphics card, which uses an Nvidia 8800 GeForce GT chip.  This is a good--but by no means top-of-the-line--graphics card.  I am running it on Vista Home Basic 32 bit with 4 GB of memory.  I also have an older Pentium IV running XP that will not load the game.  I do not have the Ageia Physx card that the game recommends.    The bottom line is that you should not expect CM2 to run on your kids' old hand-me-down computers.  But if you have purchased a system within the last year or so, it will probably work just fine on it.    IMPROVED ELEMENTS AND PHYSICS.    Like versions 1.0and 1.5, you solve puzzles by putting elements together.  This is done largely by affixing them to a lab wall.    The arsenal of elements has been hugely expanded in version 2.0.  I have not counted them, but I think there are around 150, ranging from simple devices like ropes and weights to more complex elements like voltage regulators, televisions, toasters, cannons, gear shafts, transmission boxes, etc.    Some of the elements are broken down into components.  For example, you assemble a switch by connecting a switch base--which has the power input and output--to the actual switching device (e.g., a  mechanical, motion-sensitive, laser activated switch).  Likewise, the CM2 robot can be assembled in various ways.  This componentization effectively expands the number of elements well beyond the 150 or so standard ones.    The elements look and behave much, much, more realistically than in earlier versions.  They are rendered beautifully in three dimensions.  Most of the elements have a weathered abused-in-the-lab-for-years look to them.  Many of them consist of multiple moving parts.    Unlike prior versions, the game now works with the scroll wheel on your mouse, so you can zoom in to look at the elements of your project.  Once zoomed in, you can easily move over to an adjacent part of the project (by clicking and holding the scroll wheel while moving the mouse).  Even better, you can change the perspective (by pressing the Alt key while clicking and holding down the scroll wheel and moving the mouse).  This way, you can look at parts of your project from all angles.  Doing this really makes the three-dimensionality of the game pop out.    The elements now behave more like their real-world counterparts.  Ropes break when put under too much stress.  Candles burn down.  Batteries die.  Bottles shatter realistically.  Wooden boxes splinter apart when dropped.  The list goes on and on.  This addition of realistic physics really enhances the gameplay.     Viewing theimproved graphics and physics, I can see why the game is more taxing on computers than earlier versions.  This is unfortunate for those who wish to use it on older systems.  But for my money, it is well worth it.  In any event, Moore's law means that this will become less and less a problem over time.    GAMEPLAY    You proceed through the game by solving puzzles.  The main game consists of a set of 150 puzzles that are organized into different \\"chapters\\" containing 10 games each.  The overall theme is a \\"world tour,\\" with each chapter containing graphics and music from a particular part of the world.  For example, there is a Greece chapter, with ancient columns and statues, an Alaska chapter with log cabins an moose antlers, and Egypt chapter, etc.  The puzzles themselves are loosely tied to the theme.  There also is an introductory chapter that teaches you how to use the game and many of its elements.    As one would expect, the puzzles go from easier to harder.  You have to solve most--but not all--of the puzzles of a given chapter to proceed to the next chapter.  Within a chapter, you may solve the puzzles in any order you like.  That way, if you get stuck, you can go to another puzzle within the chapter.  This is a welcome improvement over 1.0 and 1.5, which only let you proceed one puzzle at a time--causing frustration when you got stuck.    Another improvement over 1.0 and 1.5 is the addition of subsidiary goals.  For each puzzle, there is a main goal (e.g., put the ball in the basket), and a subsidiary goal (e.g., also pop the balloon and turn on the light).  You are given different medals depending on whether you accomplish the subsidiary goals.  The addition of these subsidiary goals means that the game is more accessible to players of various skill levels.  You don't have to accomplish all the subsidiary goals to get to the next chapter.  So less-skilled players still will be able to advance through the game without getting too frustrated.    Finally, CM2offers hints--both verbal and visual (you can briefly glimpse a portion of the planned layout).  The game limits the number of hints you can get for a given puzzle, and you lose points when you ask for hints.    In short, the game allows you to be as challenged as you want to be.  The refinements in gameplay solve a major problem from the earlier version--getting stuck and not being able to move on to a different unsolved puzzle.    MY LAB    In addition to solving the puzzles designed by the game, you can create your own puzzles--or just tinker around with the various elements--in the \\"My Lab\\" section.  In this section, you devise your own experiments and are given the full range of elements to do so (except for those that need to be \\"unlocked\\").    Devising an experiment is straightforward.  You put the elements in place, identify which elements are locked (i.e., fixed in place for the solver), and identify the \\"targets\\" of the experiment (i.e., what needs to be done in order to solve the puzzle).  You can test your experiment at each stage, to see whether it works.    This is a fantastic aspect of the game.  It basically enables you to extend the game indefinitely beyond the 150 puzzles included in the game.  With the game's new internet capabilities (see below), you can share your new puzzles with users from around the world.  And you can attempt to solve puzzles that they create.    INTERNET CAPABILITIES    New to Crazy Machines in version 2.0 is the ability to share problems and solutions with other CM2 users via the Internet.  You can create an online CM2 identity, which enables you to (1) look at other players' solutions to the 150 puzzles (after you have solved it), (2) upload your solutions to the problem, (3) post new experiments for others to solve, and (4) solve experiments that others can solve.    The internet interface is relatively easy to navigate.  Because the game is new, there currently is not much content on the web.  But with time and the development of a CM2 community, I expect that this will become a major addition to the game.    FUN QUOTIENT    In case it is not apparent from the above discussion, the game is great fun.  And its appeal transcends age.  I am a 38-year-old lawyer and I play it with my 7-year-old son.  I don't know who enjoys it more.  It also is a game where parents and children can play together, as equals.    Notwithstanding all that fun, it also is educational.  It encourages creative problem solving and also introduces the users to fundamental facts about gravity, mechanics, electricity, light--and how to convert one of these forms of energy into another.  I really wish that such a thing existed when I was a (younger) child.    CONCLUSION    I have been waiting over a year for CM2 to come out.  It was scheduled for release in 2007, but came out only recently.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, the CM2 exceeds my expectations.  In addition to the greatly improved graphics, the expanded arsenal of elements, and the improved physics, the game adds new aspects to the gameplay--like hints and internet collaboration--that greatly improve its playability.    As for those worried about the performance their current system, I would advise them to take a $20 gamble.  The worst-case scenario is that CM2 is unplayable now, but will be playable when you next upgrade your system.  It will be just as fun a year from now.	2008-07-14

My USB mouse, which worked perfectly during the install of SuSE Linux 8, stopped operating after the final reboot. (The USB mouse worked perfectly under SuSE Linux 7.3, so this is a new bug they inadvertantly created.)  <br />Worse, 3D acceleration can't be set for my video card (ATI Radeon) - it keeps reverting to &quot;Disabled&quot;. It could in v7.3. Again, another new bug in SuSE Linux 8.  I purchased a GeForce 3 video card, and although SuSE 8 detected the new card without fail, I couldn't properly enable 3d acceleration either.<br />Worst of all is SuSE's support. I registered the product and asked for help, knowing I'd have 90 days of free support. They have yet to respond, it's been days! They should have responded by now... perhaps they're overwhelmed with complaints. I am looking into a refund as these problems are unacceptable, but I doubt I'll get one. I will likely try Red Hat v7.3 next.  SuSE used to be great, but I'm not sure anymore.	2002-05-22

AVG have stuck with the interface and it really does look very nice! Internet Security 2014 from AVG is so much more than just your normal anti-virus, it also protects your personal information and helps to keep you safe when using social networking sites as well as online banking. Preventing online spam and scammers, stopping unsecure links and files and accelerated web performance are just some of the reasons why you should download AVG Internet Security 2014.<br /><br />In terms of different features AVG Internet Security 2014 is absolutely packed with them which we always love to see. Instead of going into too much depth that nobody understands below I have summarised them for you.<br /><br />When you purchase IS 2014 you get the following products: AntiVirus, AntiMalware (AVG Resident Shield), AVG Anti-Rootkit, AVG Email Scanner, AVG Protective Cloud Technology, AVG Community Protection Network, AVG Social Networking Protection and also the AVG LinkScanner Surf-Shield.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AntiVirus<br />-------------------<br />Helps stop, remove and prevent the speading of viruses, worms or trojans<br /><br />-------------------<br />AntiMalware (AVG Resident Shield)<br />-------------------<br />Protects you from malware on your PC and helps stop anything that’s infected.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Anti-Rootkit<br />-------------------<br />Detects and removes dangerous rootkits that hide malicious software that seeks to take control of your computer.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Email Scanner<br />-------------------<br />Detects infected or rogue inbound attachments so they can’t damage your PC. Works as a plug-in for email applications including Microsoft Outlook® 2010 or as a scanner for POP3, SMTP and IMAP accounts.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Protective Cloud Technology<br />-------------------<br />Identifies and prevents emerging threats “in the cloud” via automatic updates to your antivirus software.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Community Protection Network<br />-------------------<br />Instantly converts every new threat encountered by any member of our community into protection for everyone. It adds up to ever-better antivirus protection for the entire AVG community.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG LinkScanner® Surf-Shield<br />-------------------<br />Smart prevention technology that stops you hitting infected or criminal sites. Actively checks every web page just before you click and stops you if it detects anything suspicious.<br />This integrates nicely into most popular browsers and simply colour codes the links and websites depending on how safe they are. If you’re still unsure about whether or not a link is safe simply submit it to AVG before you visit it.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Social Networking Protection<br />-------------------<br />Checks the links that get exchanged when you’re on social networks such as Facebook®, Twitter® etc. to help keep you and your friends safe.<br /><br />-------------------<br />AVG Threat Removal<br />-------------------<br />Over the past few years our inbox’s have starting to become more and more cluttered with spam email and scams. The included AVG Anti-Spam will help prevent you getting these type of emails and falling prey to phishing scams such as those you believe to be from your real bank.<br /><br />If you thought that Internet Security 2014 was just an Anti-Virus then you couldn’t be further from the truth. As well as keeping your PC safe it will also help to improve and optimize performance. One way in which it does this is using AVG Turbo Scan.<br />Turbo Scan dramatically reduces the scanning times thanks to a brand new scanning sequence that follows the order in which files are saved to your HDD. As with a few other products on the market AVG include a Game Mode which stops scans starting and updates taking place while gaming in order to help reduce the lag and avoid freezes.<br /><br />Another included component is the AVG Accelerator. If you enjoy spending hours on YouTube clicking through the sidebar of videos taking you to unknown places then you will love this little bit of kit. The accelerator maximizes your connection speed and the download of binary data to deliver you faster, smoother video streaming.<br /><br />Updates to the security suite occur quite regularly which is good to see as you know AVG are actively looking for the new threats and attempting to block them. Similarly to the Game Mode, if your computer is running low on battery Internet Security will realise this and will hold off updating to help save your battery. One unfortunate thing we noticed is that parental controls are no longer included and actually has to be purchased as an add-on.<br />-------------------<br />Our Verdict<br />-------------------<br />Overall the AVG Internet Security 2014 suite continues to improve with every release and this is no doubt their best release yet. The user interface is so easy to use and even if you’re completely new to the software finding the settings you need or the program is easily done. The biggest update to this release we think are the vast array of privacy tools which are sure to come in use. The main screens of the UI can be easily used by touch-screen users while the settings menu is still aimed at mouse users. We would like to see the settings menus updated so that it is more easily used by those who have just touch-screen devices.<br />All in all another solid and quality program by AVG which does its job perfectly!<br /><br />Read more at [...]u enjoy spending hours on YouTube clicking through the sidebar of videos taking you to unknown places then you will love this little bit of kit.

And I found that by putting my mind to it, I taught myself Microsoft Visual Basic, Visual C#, and even though I am only 16 I even managed to teach myself Visual C++. All I am going to say about this product is, lets face it, there is no effective way to write software then in a programing language like the ones listed above. If you don't like microsoft, there are many other companies also that develop similar products. Either way do your self a favor, rather than trying a dummy tool that probably won't get the job done, just learn how to program. It really aint that hard.	2004-12-23

Several months ago, I upgraded to Version 6 and immediately began having problems with the software shutting down unexpectedly when editing photos. Adobe was no help at all in resolving the problem. I quit using the software (found Picasssa works pretty well) for awhile and then decided to upgrade to Version 7.0. Guess what? Same problem occurred with that version. When I first open the software in editing mode, it seems to load okay, and then I get the error message that says it has to shut down. Once again, the only suggestions you get from Adobe is like the advice from Microsoft when the same thing happens to their operating systems: sorry! I am using a computer with XP Pro, 2 GB memory, 3.02GHZ P4 processor and over 500GB of drive space. I have read complaints from others having the same problem on both versions. Unfortunatey most users are on their own in coming up with fixes to broken software. I may have to reinstall Version 5 to get software that works properly, and live without some of the newer features. I would hestitate to recommend this upgrade to anyone based on my personal experience with it.	2008-12-24

If you are not very picky about your protection software, I highly recommend it.  If you are picky, and especially if you want to control the details of what it does, you are out of luck unless you are a Windows expert.    Here is an example: I wanted the McAfee virus protection (which is a pretty good one), but I did not want the McAfee Firewall.  The McAfee Firewall is truly paranoid, and it does not (easily) allow me to do any fancy stuff on my home network.  Configuring it is a nightmare.  McAfee has a button to turn off the Firewall, and if you click it, it says that the Firewall is turned off.  In fact it pops-up a message saying that \\"your computer is not fully protected any more\\".  Despite that, McAfee still blocks the Windows Firewall, by not allowing it to start.  In fact even the Windows Control Panel (Windows-7 64-bit) could not start the Windows Firewall (even after a reboot.)  At the end, I found it easier to enter the Windows task manager and edit the McAfee services directly by hand, and reboot immediately.  After that, the Windows Firewall took over, and I configured it to my liking.  But still, every time I log into my machine it pops-out a false message that my computer is not fully protected, despite the fact Windows Firewall is now running.	2010-05-10

It's not particularly user friendly, but   if you spend enough time and get their online help, it produces a nice slideshow.  The problem is that the software is inherently limited in the quality of DVD it can produce.  The slideshows look fine on the computer, and if that's all you ever want to do, it's fine.  But if you ever want to view your pictures on TV via a DVD, forget it.  Very poor, blurry picture is the best you can hope for.    Here's their customer service solution:      Thank you for your message.    Whenever you go from a slide show to a DVD there will be a loss of quality. This is due to a few factors.    1. Depending on how high of a resolution your pictures are the down scaling in our program may not be as good as a dedicated photo editor. You can try and scale down the pictures before loading them into a slide show.    2. DVD resolution is just lower quality, depending on the destination often you can just export the slide show in a higher quality codec than DVD. From the file menu simply choose export slide show and choose something like Quick Time or Windows Media as an example. These files can normally be played back on a computer but not a DVD player.    3. The final option is to burn a blu ray disc as this creates a slide show in HD.    The best option if this must go on DVD is to scale down the pictures before they are brought into the slide show using a photo editor program.	2011-04-26

SonicFoundry's Video Factory is an excellent video editing tool:  you get two seperate video streams (one to overlay text onto your video and even create scrolling credits!) and three separate audio streams (voice, music, and sound effects!).  While they are called voice and music streams, you can put whatever you want in it.  The video transitions (fading, etc) are unbelieveable!  You can fade directly from one clip to another, or just fade to black.  Video Factory took me approximately 15 minutes to learn the basics using their highly effective tutorials.  I've already edited home movies taken on mini-VHS tape and turned a lot of funny scenes into a &quot;best-of&quot; my family movie.  The resulting movies you can make are great for presents for relatives.  And best of all, you just tell Video Factory what you plan to do with your finished movie - put it on a VHS tape, put it on the web, email it - and Video Factory will pick the optimal format to turn your movie into.<br />In other words - I highly recommend it!	2001-10-29

The use of standard mathematical notations makes it very easy to follow the logic of calculations in a worksheet (as opposed to code based interface of other software packages). It also allows very fast learning - you can start doing your calculations with Mathcad almost immediately, even if you never used it before. <br /> <br />Mathcad combines ability to do numerical calculations with a very intuitive way to work with symbolic mathematics. It is not as advanced as Matlab for programming and data based numerical computations, but is far superior if you want to work with mathematical functions and operators as opposed to just array of numbers. In this way Mathcad is similar to Maple, but its interface is much more intuitive. I found that in 90% of cases Mathcad was more convenient to use for me that Matlab or Maple. <br /> <br />One drawback is that Mathcad has somewhat limited ability to customize the appearance of graphs. It is enough to make rough plots of data to analyze results, but it is generally not sufficient to make publication quality graphs. In this case I normally generate data sets with Mathcad and plot it with more specialized software such as Origin. Also, it is not always optimized for speed - large scale computations make take long time. But if you are in business of doing large scale computations, you are probable using custom developed code anyway. <br /> <br />Overall Mathcad is excellent tool for most day-to-day calculations.	2005-08-20

After using this product for a couple of weeks, I am inclined to agree with another reviewer who stated that these positive reviews must have been posted by 321 employees.<BR>I have yet to make a single working DVD copy with this piece of junk!  (And don't tell me about system requirements...  I have the software installed on a machine with more than enough horsepower).<BR>A few examples of some of the many issues:<BR>(1) The program can't decide whether it recognizes my DVD burner.  Sometimes it does; sometimes it doesn't.  Even when every other application can access it just fine.<BR>(2) The initial process of first creating the DVD image on the hard drive completes error-free about two-thirds of the time.  The other times I get an error message, and the application either gets hung, or shuts itself down altogether.<BR>(3) The actual copy process has NEVER actually finished.  Sometimes it gets hung during early in the process.  Other times it bombs out toward the very end.  This is particularly frustrating when you've just invested over an hour of your time waiting for the copy to finish.<BR>(4) Forget tech support, and definitely forget finding anything useful in an instruction manual or online help screen.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!	2003-03-06

I guess the fact that it took more than thirty minutes to load on my computer, a computer with a 2GHZ processor and 2 GB of RAM, should have been a clue.  This software, while adorned with more bells and whistles than one can imagine, is basically a big clunker.  It it so big and clunky that it takes five minutes to open the program everytime you want to use it and it then proceeds to consume all of the computers resources while operating.  Several features in the software appear not to work, such as Audio Capture.  My sound card works great with everything else I do, but Roxio can't recognize the sound card.  The process of making a movie is cumbersome and complicated for the average user and you really have to read their entire 200 page manual (not provided but online) to learn the basics.

The entire user interface is mostly smartphone style.  Simple things like a game of Solitaire is a wait and a project.  The included mail app downloads mail from the server with no way (so far??) to turn that feature off so mail can remain available on the server for other devices.  IE 10 has none of the usual interface controls its exactly like a smartphone browser, back and forth, back and forth, click, click, click.  When you finally get to the traditional style desktop things become more familiar but with no start button its more back and  forth to the Metro home screen.

Having spent countless hours attemping to make an image copy of my laptop's c: drive using Ghost 10.0 I can say without hesitation that this product does not work. The destination drive (the one copied to) fails to boot when used as the main c: drive -- either it fails with a disk read error, or Windows begins to load and then stops half-way. Symantec's technical support is clueless. Chat rooms point to Ghost's log files which indicate that the copying process registers various failures in the image being made. Symantec's web support admits to problems with image copies but has no useful suggestions for solving the problem. I know because I tried them all in vain. I even purchased a new drive with the same results. If you are in need of wasting many hours of your life buy Ghost 10.0. Stay away from this product.

It shows up as a credit on my Amazon order account. However, they never credited my Amazon credit card for the return. Unfoftunately I did not see this problem until December. Now it seems questionable as to whether I will receive a credit to my account as it has been almoost six months. The credit card company for Amazon (Chase) blew me off. The customer service department for Amazon, located in Costa Rica, will not give me a confirmation number although they say they will send me an email. The customer service is poor for the Amazon credit card and Amazon. I will not be ordering anything from Amazon again unless they refund my money.	2010-01-25

I upgraded from 2001.  One of the things I was looking for was better 401K mgmt.  It's virtually impossible to truly track 401K activity, but this allows you to make regular updates to your holdings without having to do a makeshift update like I used to do.  That's one of the few pluses to this version vs. 2001.<br />But the interface is terrible.  The account list is on an all white background instead of the grid-line style that it used to have, which now makes it hard to read across.  Once you go into an account, you cannot close the register view window - you have to click on another icon or account to go into something else.  I'm having a tough time getting used to that.  Why would they take something simple as the _ O X window sizing option that was in all previous versions through at least 2001?<br />The customization of the interface is very poor.  Nowadays, most software allows you to change numerous viewing options including colors, fonts, etc.  Quicken 2004 gives you none of that.  You are stuck with the setup they provide and are forced to view tons of graphs and charts, which may be useful in some cases, but should be more customizable for those who prefer other views.  If I can find a way to save my data file to a previous version, I will be downgrading back to 2001 (...)	2003-12-30

With this version, they updated that to &#34;the Vault&#34; and once logged in, EVERY page I go to that has a space to be filled it puts in my username which I absolutely hate and a huge annoyance.<br /><br />BUT for the price and the fact I can use it with my laptop, tablet, phone, and work computer; it makes it hard to complain.<br /><br />Does a great job of protecting my systems from phishing threats as well as viruses...so 5 star on that part	2013-07-10

I installed this Ghost 12 product on my computer (3.2GHz Pentium 4 running on Windows XP Pro with SP2) and it automatically installed all new updates from Symantec. I then used the copy feature to copy all my C:\ drive (114GB) files including boot segment and turned the 2nd hard-drive (500GB) partition on as active after the copy is done as recommended. The copy finished without a problem, I then removed my old C:\ drive and reboot the PC. The new drive (500GB) is seen as C:\ and seemed to come up but then it hung with the Windows logo on a blue screen back ground. I sent an email to Symantec but has not received any reply. I went to their web-site to check and noticed that Symantec recommended for older Ghost version (11 or previous), the user should remove most of application programs for the copy feature to work correctly. Years ago this was not the case for old Ghost software..I guess that softwares have become so complex that Symantec could not keep up and made it work properly with Windows now aday. I guessed if I remove all my application softwares then the Ghost copy feature would work but then I have to re-install the softwares again plus their updates. This is too much work and again there is no guarantee if it would work because I am using version 12 with all updates. Since then I just used my old hard drive (114GB) again and made the large drive as another drive which is OK. I will remove the Ghost 12 from my computer very soon. To me this software is just a waste of money. I will never buy Semantec product again. I have a similar problem with Norton Antivirus 2007 program (hang the PC after installing all updates.. probably a conflict with other software) but that is another sad story :(	2007-11-24

The improvements are quite gradual, although in Ver. 13 the program has several valuable editing tools included to mirror the full Photoshop Big Brother. At the same time, Adobe seems to have abandoned the very useful Organizer appearance of past editions. I transferred the albums from ver. 9, only to find that they are not appearing in the new version. I needed to contact online forums to get some more insights into the changes (Adobe's user forum is notorious for offering little detail). On the other hand, this is one part of the Adobe product line that has not yet forced us into the Adobe Cloud with its usurious subscription model. I have not yet tried the Premier component, but I do expect to find some surprising changes that force me to learn from others what I can do about compiling and editing my videos.	2015-04-20

Plus, the model you have in ViaCAD will be a true solid model (compared with TurboCAD Deluxe).  Also, you'll have many, many more features and tools found only on 3D modeling programs costing much, much more.  In my opinion, this program walks circles around TurboCAD (Deluxe & Pro) and AutoCAD.<br /><br />However, I would caution anyone who purchases this to first have a good computer.  CAD programs are resource hogs, and this one is no different.  You want a good processor, a lot of memory and a very good graphics card.  Those recommended specifications listed on the box are MINIMUM REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS.  Secondly, take your time and learn it properly using the included tutorials.  CAD is not something that you can just pick up and learn in five minutes.  It takes time and experience to become proficient with any CAD program.

I have been very pleased with this. It is much more stable than 98SE, 98 or 95. It is more stable than my 2000 as well. It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0. It is finally multi-user (not multi-account like 2000), so all users can stay logged on with applications running. That being said, to use that functionality, you definitely want to heed the &quot;minimum requirements&quot;.	2002-09-30

We could visualize different scenerios for our home.  We are still learning to use the program to its capacity, I have to admit.  But the learning curve is a bit steep.  We are pretty computer savvy people and we have had a hard time learning the program.  We are getting better and better as time goes on.  But you should be prepared to spend some time on it.  It didn't help that we already ripped a chimney out and needed an action plan ASAP!    However, if you can spend the time on it, the options are pretty vast.  You can visualize many different scenerios before actually doing anything to your home.  In the long run this is going to save us lots of money that we would have otherwise spent on screwups.      Overall, we like it now.  In the beginning we didn't.      *This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User   Community (NDUC).

The software worked well with few issues observed during testing.  One of the new features included in AutoCAD 2013 is cloud storage capability. The software is able to sync files onto a cloud operated by Autodesk and thus make files available to others in or outside the organization.  Included in the products price is 3 Gb of online storage.  This feature seemed to work well except for an occasional sync error.  I am confident based on prior use of Autodesk products that the company will work hard to address significant issues with release of one or two service packs.<br /><br />Other features such as PDF worked fine. Compatiblity with earlier AutoCAD drwings was also satisfactory.<br /><br />I have used almost all of the competing products out there and there is really nothing better than AutoCAD.  The strength of the product comes mostly from the logically thought out and intuitive basic drawing tools.  I assume these tool designs are patented because none of the competitors seem to \\"get it\\".<br /><br />I see this software as  an excellent upgrade to an already fine product.	2012-05-23

My last version prior to this was 6.0 which I loved to use for sales processing and synching all activities with my Palm Treo 300 cell phone.  Last year-based on the super negative reviews of Act 2006-I purchased a copy of GoldMine with the intention of replicating my PC to Palm link and increasing performance.  After almost a year of research, failed efforts, and unhappy experiences I have returned to using Act as my primary CM.  Golmine is ugly, hard to set up, and structurally non-intuitive.  It certainly performs the function of a CM, but many little details make the process cumbersome.  It is supposed to be extremely powerful, and it certainly is much faster than Act, but it appears that a lot of custom programming is required to get it to peak performance. <br /> <br />So now I use Act 2007 on my PC and Act for the Palm on my Treo 700p.  Although Act is moderately slow to load and change screens, its' features, attractive GUI, and relative ease of use more than compensate for its' speed.  I have about 1000 contacts in my DB and 1 Gig of Ram and Act loads in about 15 seconds, changes queries in about 2 seconds,and performs a keyword search in about 10 seconds.  I love the ability this system gives me to load contact information and notes on my pc and access them on my Treo during my sales day.  Notes and New Contacts or information from my PDA phone are flawlessly synched with my pc each afternoon.  Compared to many of the more sophisticated users on this review page I am a relative novice, but Act gives me all the tools I need to control my sales effort and keep me in regular touch with my customers.  I'll not give this program a 5 due to its' speed, but the power and ease of use make it worth a strong 4.	2006-11-27

Got it for $35.  Doesn't offer much in the way of editing.  Never was able to cut video clips and save to separate files.  So never used it very much.  If you just want to do simple things, like adding graphics, it's OK.  Aside from its limitations, every time I put a disk into the PC that has any video file (I do this all the time with work-related video), the program starts up and takes over the screen.  I have to wait for the program to load and then immediately close it out.  I don't want to use this program for watching videos.  Something is in the registry that automatically starts up their program if any video file is detected on a disk.  Never was able to figure out a way to stop it from doing that.  Solved it by uninstalling their software.  Not surprisingly, the uninstallation process hijacked my screen (and thus my computer) for one final time. I love Corel Wordperfect (would never use any other word processor), but Corel VideoStudio is no Wordperfect.	2015-01-30

I installed a pair of Western Digital 1 Terabyte drives.  A downloaded version of Acronis True Image Home came with the drives.  I downloaded and installed the WD version 9 of Acronis and backed up my C: drive to my D: drive.  It worked flawlessly and was very intuitive.  I was very pleased with the shortened version that Western Digital provide so I ordered the Acronis 2011 version from Amazon.  I carefully followed the installation instructions and installed the 2011 version which deleted version 9.  I then attempted to back up my C: drive again to test the new version and:  Wham bang, my computer crashed.  2011 rearranged the labeling of my disk drives where they were out of sequence and my computer booted up in safe mode.  Thankfully the backup copy I made with version 9 on my D: drive was still intact so I was able to restore my C: drive with version 9.  This is a very unstable program which may work OK but sooner or later (In my case very sooner) you will have a messed up computer.  Version 9 is very good and I understand from the comments on this site that version 10 is very good.  Stay away from version 2011, it is a looser.	2011-03-06

The support is not available after 6 PM pacific time. That is very stressful.     Support people have difficulty with English. If you say \\"Window\\", they hear \\"vendor\\". You can figure out that they are trying to talk with an American accent. One of them even told me that her name is \\"Cherry\\" (really sounded like Cherry). When I asked her to spell it, she said C_H_E_R_Y_L. That is, she did not know that she has to call herself \\"Sheril\\".

I was not paid by Microsoft for this glowing review. In fact,  I used to hate Microsoft. So much so that for over two years I ran IBM OS/2  Warp (3.0 and 4.0) on my previous machine. Oh, and I am a home user. I  don't use computers at work at all.<br />That said, I have a few comments to  make before getting into my own opinions about Win2k. About drivers.  Microsoft has provided so many drivers for so many devices with their other  OSes that people have come to expect this as a matter of course. But, as  anyone (FreeBSD geek included) who has ever set up a non-Microsoft system  can tell you, finding drivers for your computer can be difficult. Microsoft  did an outstanding job in this area with Win2k. They went out of their way  to provide a utility for you to test your system's Win2k compatibility  before you fork out the bucks. Use it. Then carefully plan your  upgrade.<br />I titled this review &quot;The Best OS For Home Use&quot;, while  several others warn home users to steer clear of Win2k. Well, in my  experience, Win2k does not crash, ever. I do not have to reboot, ever. That  means I don't have to think much about the software that runs my computer.  Most home users would prefer to never have to do that.<br />As a consequence I  am forced to actually use my computer to...do something. I run Excel to do  my finances, surf the Web with up to 20 windows open at a time, edit  graphics files in Paint Shop Pro, and write occasional letters in Word. I  do not play games on my computer.<br />My brother, on the other hand, has  three sons and a wife. They all share the same computer and internet  connection (if AOL can be called the internet) with Win95. His hard drive  is packed with MP3's because his older son spends hours downloading them.  He has no room left for more data files, let alone software. When his  computer starts there are several error messages because of missing  files.<br />Win2k requires each user to log on with a user name and password.  Each user has a quota of disk space allocated to them. And system files are  protected from curious little users who wonder what would happen if they  delete command.com (cmd.exe in Win2k).<br />The system is also protected from  users who think it would be cool to load every piece of software known to  Kiddom. Only someone with administrator rights can do that.<br />For those who  are paranoid about others prying into their files, each user can encrypt  his or her own. And for parents who want to keep their wayward sons and  daughters from getting on the internet while they are still at work,  anyone's user account can be disabled and re-enabled at any time.<br />None of  these features was included with home use in mind. They are all intended to  keep wayward employees from trashing corporate machines. Yet they are  perfect for home use. Add to it the stability I have experienced with  Windows 2000 and you have an unbeatable OS for your home computer.	2000-09-17

In the last few days our computer was attacked several times and this program fended off the attacks.  My husband is really the computer savvy one, but I use the computer daily.  (I just don't know as much of the intricacies as he does) So, from a normal computer users stand point I think this product does the job well.  It is funny though how you never really think that YOUR personal information and YOUR computer is at risk for a virus untill you actually read a report that someone tried to plant a virus or hack into your computer.  Which is what happened to us.  And I also have to say, it is pretty cool that this program allows you to track down alot of information (in most cases) on the attcker.  So you get to find out where they are and alot of their specific information so that you can pass it on to your internet service provider so they can take action.  All in all I'd say I've learned my lesson that everyone needs an internet security program, (my husband had been trying to convice me for some time), and this program seems to work pretty well.	2003-01-08

Like Movie Magic 2000, Final Draft and Scriptware, you get the TAB and ENTER system of entering Scenes and Character Names. You'll lose some of the higher end features (like card view) but for basic script input (especially for spec scripts) Hollywood Screenwriter will probably do what you need, especially if you're a beginner.<br />You do need to download the latest updates from Screenplay Systems, especially if you are using Windows Me, 2000 or XP (othewise you might get an &quot;Error 32 Message&quot;). You should also look at the new spec script formats that can be downloaded from Screenplay System's web site. They allow you to stop using Character CONT'Ds in your scripts, as this is becoing outdated.<br />Hollywood Screenwriter doesn't have as many export options as its bigger brother, Movie Magic 2000, but it *does* have RTF and ASCII, which means it should interact with just about any Windows word processor or Screenplay software.<br />For the price and features, Hollywood Screenwriter is a great program. Check Screenplay System's comparison chart for feature differences between it and Movie Magic 2000 before buying, but there's a good chance that if you are writing a spec script, Hollywood Screenwriter will do the job.	2002-06-28

Compared to prior versions of microsoft word, it's a mess.  Even disregarding all prior knowledge of previous versions, and treating it as its own separate entity, it's a mess.    M$ did a great job making commonly used, extremely necessary functions, nearly impossible to figure out.  Want to center your title?  Too bad.  Word will center the entire paper.  I try highlighting just that line to center it...but nope, that still centers the entire paper.  I dig for 10 minutes through the piss-poor help file, read the convoluted explanation, and still cannot figure it out.    They did away with the common-sense file menu, and replaced it with a malformed Microsoft logo, almost as if to taunt you every time you are scrambling to find a function.  It even saves the files in a new \\"docx\\" format, destroying all file compatibility with older versions.  The only way to make your files compatible is to save in \\"word 97-2003 compatible\\" mode.  Avoid this terrible program, and all of Office 2007 at ALL COSTS.	2008-09-24

I tried Norton Antivirus, McAfee, and AVG but this is the best I have tried.  Norton Antivirus is the worst security suite for a computer. I had it installed on a computer (came with preinstalled version active for 90 days) and the next day I uninstalled because the laptop was taking forever to load all the programs at startup.  From my experience with all these security programs I loved the one made by Softwin.  I used a 30 day trial and who is saying that Bitdefender is like a beta testing program is right. But, when I bought a license for 2yr/3pc the things had changed.   From the start I have to say if you don't know how to configure it than don't even bother with it. Call someone who knows. If you just install the program at its default settings then the firewall is a huge problem for every program. It will block automatically any program which is not in its \\"white list\\" and you will realize some vital program you installed on your computer will not work anymore, and this will become a very annoying problem which will lead at dissatisfaction with the product. This is the flaw for Bitdefender's suite. But if you know how to configure it become obsolete for your computer. You just have to set the advance mode and at firewall you have to set to ask. It will be a little annoying at the beginning until creates a personalized white list and you can edit this list any time you need. Another setting I would suggest is to set to scan programs file only. You don't need any antivirus to scan every text file you access.   There is too much to say about this product and much about its pros.  On the downside, who says is getting focused on update is right. But it is not the case with starting Total Security 2008. With previous version I had the same problem, but with this one this issue disappeared.   Usually I don't make recommendation to my friends because every one has its own experience withsoftware programs (it does not matter if its for a particular operating system), but when is the case for an antivirus I told them to buy Bitdefender. Is cheap, almost impenetrable, daily updates, reliable (with a little tweaking), and the most important it is not eating from your computer's performance like Norton Antivirus, or McAfee.	2009-02-12

Quicken Essentials for Mac is a terrible, terrible, terrible piece of software … there are probably better free or shareware apps available on the internet. I'm going to look.<br /><br />The reviews of this program are not good, but the ones I read complained about online banking and check writing … features that I don't use. I simply want to track my spending, so all I need is a 'Cash' ledger, with 'Reports' print-out options. Pretty basic stuff. This program can't even do that in a satisfying manner.<br /><br />I have used Quicken 2005 for since it came out … it did everything I needed and more, very efficiently, with great flexibility. I would still be using it, but recently it started losing data … stuff just disappeared … so I thought I would upgrade. I traded one unacceptable situation for another unacceptable situation.<br /><br />With Quicken Essentials for Mac there is almost no flexibility in how reports  are organized. There is a 'Settings' window, but it is just about useless. For instance, if you want the last Quarter organized with sub-columns of the monthly Category totals … it can't be done in the setting window. You will have to print out each month's Category totals and then print out the quarter Category totals … 4 sheets of paper to get what fits easily on one sheet of paper. Quicken 2005 did this effortlessly.<br /><br />The printed reports themselves do not make good use of the printed page. They are spread out with lots of white space … and worst of all is the unchangeable 'Tiny' … I mean, read with a magnifying glass … font sizes.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed in Intuit Quicken Essentials for Mac … I am returning it … I would recommend that you don't buy it!	2014-02-16

I am about halfway through level 1 Chinese and am having a great time and really learning Chinese! My sister in law is a native speaker and she says I am doing well with the pronounciation and grammer. I think the reviewers who said the method was too confusing maybe weren't giving it a chance. One of the ways they introduce new words is this: they show you a picture of say bread and say 'mian bao', then repeat (different picture of bread then \\"mian bao\\") then they say \\"mian bao\\" and give you three pictures to choose from (one of which is a picture of bread). Then they show a picture of an apple and say \\"ping guo\\" and repeat \\"ping guo\\" and give you the same three pictures (bread, apple and egg) you choose apple. Then they say \\"jie dan\\" and you pick the only picture you haven't used yet... the egg. Now you know the words for bread, apple, and egg. I am not good at memorizing things, and I am learning very quickly (we've had the program about one month and I am halfway through it. My older two kids (ages 13 and 10) are also doing it, and although they are not going as quickly as I am, they are able to do it without too much trouble. I highly recommend this program for anyone who is an auditory or visual learner. Another great feature is that the lessons are mostly very short, 5 to 15 minutes average, so if you don't have big blocks of time you can still achieve a lot in a short time. There is a lot of repetition so everything you learn is reinforced.  Happy learning and Zia Jiian (good bye)	2010-05-16

I have been using the product for three days now, and can safely say you should avoid this product.  I have a MacBook Pro mid-2010 that is maxed out with the fastest processor and 8GB ram.  After loading the software (and updating to 2.1), then completing the training with a $149 Logitech headset, I was initially impressed.  When dictating in Dragon Dictate's own version of textedit, the dictation was very accurate and the variety of controls was impressive.  I also liked that the software could open any application on the mac and \\"jump to amazon,\\" which meant open Safari and go to Amazon's website.  The con in all this was that the software crashes -- a lot.  Probably every ten minutes.  It reminded me of my old PC days.  That would have been bearable if it's all I wanted Dragon Dictate to do.  Unfortunately, I purchased this software because the website touted its compatibility with MS Word 2011 for Mac.  Let me be as clear as possible on this point -- this software does not work at all in MS Word 2011.  I consider myself reasonably proficient at troubleshooting both Macs and PCs, and I could never get this software to dictate one word into MS Word.  I could get it to open the MS Word application, open a document, save a document and a dozen other commands, but it would not dictate at all.  The only way to get any content into Word was to dictate it into the software's native notepad window, then cut and paste.  Epic fail.  Further research on Nuance's website revealed a number of other customers lamenting their inability to work in word.  One developer noted the problem might have to do with Apple's sandboxing of applications.  I would like to thank the reviewers who noted that Windows 7 has this functionality built in to the operating system.  I clicked over to Parallels on my mac, opened Windows and voila, there was a very decent voice recognition program that did everything Dragon Dictate for Mac did, but for free and with no crashes!  Needless to say, I will be taking advantage of the 30-day money back guarantee and getting my money back.  I may try the $49 \\"express\\" version of Dragon Dictate currently offered in Apple's App Store for the Mac.  Then again, I may not.  The Windows 7 version of speech recognition -- which I used to compose this review -- works just fine for my purposes.	2011-11-14

The rendering times are decent but the only complaint I have is there are no professional effects or add-ons.<br /><br />I've used Avvid Liquid, Final cut, Premiere and others.

In Feb. 2008, I contacted Symantec by chat because my Norton SystemWorks subscription had expired and a \\"subscription expired\\" alert was displaying every 30 seconds.  When I chose Renew inside the product, as documented, the Live Update dialog was displayed instead of the Renewal Center panel.  I waited for the chat through the 67 customers who were ahead of me.  In the chat session, the technician could not make renewal work inside the product and eventually sent me a link to the Symantec site to renew, which I did.  The product continued to display the subscription expired alert.  The technician suggested a couple of options to stop the alert, which did not work.  One of the options would have terminated the chat, which I told him when a message was displayed that indicated this.  The technician was still in the process of trying to stop the alert messages when the chat connection was lost and the chat terminated.  I was left with subscription alerts popping up every 30 seconds after I had resubscribed, and after rebooting.    When I resubscribed, I noticed that the \\"Subscription Service\\" date inside the product on the antivirus status screen was 5/9/2008 instead of one year later, 2/13/2009.  From reading tech tips on the site, I determined that when I renewed, the system date was 5/9/2008.  I corrected the system date, and the alert messages stopped.    But I still had this problem:  How do I reset the Subscription Service date inside SystemWorks to the correct date (2/13/2009) so that it does not expire in May and I have to try to contact tech support again?  After the chat which was disconnected, I submitted the question to tech support by e-mail.  After several days had passed with no response, I confirmed that no Symantec mail had been blocked as spam, then resubmitted the question twice.  Although e-mail response is committed to 96 hours, I have received no response 36 days after the original incident date.    I feel that this combination of failures of product, technical support by chat, and technical support by e-mail is noteworthy, even today when technical support routinely ranges from poor to abusive.	2008-03-19

US	38022589	R108R3OSCKHWRN	B00JKM077A	322238739	Power PDF Standard English	Software	3	1	2	Y	N	Adequate	I had a version of Acrobat Pro on my old laptop but could not find the info to reinstall when that machine died so I thought I'd try an alternative PDF program and save a few bucks. I had no problems with the install on a Windows 8 laptop.  I'm still in the learning curve but here are my first impressions:<br />Power PDF seems functional enough with a lot of the same features Adobe has. However, some of the controls aren't very intuitive. For example, when you want to zoom, you click on the magnifying glass. I was trying to click the icon over and over to increase the zoom, but you have to click the icon and then move your mouse to the document to use the zoom tool. There were also a lot of unnecessary steps when combining documents into a single PDF. Click the document in an explorer, click it again in the PDF program, then click it again to tell it where you want the document to go in the order of pages. Adobe makes this process much simpler with a drag and drop. My biggest gripe is that, unless I just haven't found it yet, redaction is only available in the professional version of this program.  I use redaction frequently enough for that to be a deal breaker.  There are a lot of functions for which this software preforms adequately, but in no respect is it superior to Adobe.  If you can afford it, I'd recommend buying the tried and true industry standard.	2014-06-29

Besides tracking almost anything you  can think of, it allows you to add items to monitor.  For example, if  you've been tracking your blood pressure and want to compare that to your  mood swings, you can track your mood for a while and then create a graph to  compare the two and see if there's a correlation.<br />Compared to other  programs, it is fast and easy to track your eating habits.  It will  retrieve a food item based on any part of the name of the food, while some  others cannot &quot;find&quot; the food unless you get the exact spelling  and order of words.<br />The calorie estimates for recipes you add are also  very accurate.  Another program I've used--MasterCook--has sometimes been  off by as much as 50 percent.<br />The best thing about this program is that  it can be as simple or as complicated as you want.  If you want to track  every blood chemical, mood, or doctor's appoinment, you can.  But if you're  looking for something to just tell you how many calories you ate today, it  will do a fast and accurate job--and not give you an annoying pop-up  reminder to do something else.	2000-08-05

I started back with the 2010 version and even though the user interface was devoid of best practices, common sense and intuition it worked OK. I upgraded to the 2012 version and it was so buggy that I went back (with much difficulty) to the 2010 version. I did the trial version of 2015 and was amazed at how they gutted the application and redesigned the UI into yet another interface devoid of best practices. It cannot decided if it wants to be a desktop application or a web page. Gone is the scheduler interface that told you whether your backups were working or not. Instead their web site instructs you on how to go to a file folder and parse the logs visually. I'll pass on that thank you very much.<br /><br />If you are tech savvy as I think that I am you can work with it but you will soon see the shortcomings of this software. If you are not tech savvy and are looking for a software backup utility that is a turnkey solution do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I think Acronis True Image 2015 gutted the software to appeal to the non-savvy people but this is only a disservice as it lends a false sense of security.<br /><br />Personally I went back and looked at a few other backup utilities. I decided that Macrium Reflect was best for my needs (scheduling, incremental backups, folder/file backup, disk space management, e-mail notification). Again, I was able to navigate the user interface relatively easily because I understand the jargon but it leans more to the techie side than the mom and pop desktop user.	2014-12-21

I have found them to be excellent supplemental tools in aquiring foreign languages. Without translations, your mind is forced to rely upon context (visual and verbal) to extract meaning. The repetive phrases ranging from one or two words to an entire paragraph engrain a syntactical map of how sentence structures are fabricated. I found that the more you work these lessons, the better they work for you. Repeating the phrases out loud each time after the speaker is much more powerful than simply listening.  <br />The Latin speakers on this product render an excellent restored Classical Latin accent; the /r/'s are trilled (unlike the liquid English /r/ produced in some other Latin softwares) and the vowels are crisp and distinguished. The lessons provide enough exercises and variations to keep one occupied for a substantial length of time. Any Latin student that dedicates one or two extra hours daily to this programme in addition to their regular Latin homework will no doubt be head of the class. <br />My only gripes are that the pictures are lower quality than other Rosetta Stone programmes; they are small and have low resolution. And there is just one level with which one can only achieve a high-basic skill level at best upon completion.	2005-10-20

After extensive research on the Symantec sevice and support website.  I was given the impression that a parallel connection is the only way to interface between my laptop and my Backpack CD-RW (suggested by the Symantec CD-RW compatibility list).  I followed the Symantec, and Backpack instructions to a tee and everytime (6 times, until I giveup) I received a 12020 error - &quot;failed to write to disk&quot; at different times during the burning process. Now, I understand software has bugs and sometimes it just does work, but at least I would think you could get some free person to person tech support for home/small business users; but with symantec that idea was tossed out the window.  Symantec provides an extensive knowledge database and its easy to understand.  But when the solution to your problem is not in the knowledgebase they expect you to pay $29 per incident; that's half the price for the software - give me a break.  Symantec is a leader in the drive cloning and backup arena and I'll give them this ghost 2002 was user friendly but overall, for my application, it was extremely slow and just didn't do the job.  That is why, if it was an option, I wouldn't give ghost 2002 any stars.  But what do they care they already have my money!	2001-12-03

US	15803669	R2GSSEO0EUHRLK	B003XMZVOW	956537903	Bible Black Game 2	Software	2	5	7	N	Y	Probably not worth it.	I haven't played the English version of the game yet, but I played through the original Japanese, so the only thing I'm missing is the story content.  But, honestly, not even that can really save this.<br /><br />Starting from the top, the art style is very uneven.  Sei Shoujo, the original creator of Bible Black, left the company that made this game years before this release.  As a cash-in, they decided to make a \\"new\\" Bible Black game using some of his art from the original game and having other artists draw the rest of the scenes.  So, while some of the art is of the traditional Sei Shoujo quality(read: Very high), the rest of the art looks like it was taken from the anime.  And, while the anime has some of the best animated art, in terms of H-games, it's really nothing special.<br /><br />In terms of length, Bible Black Infection is ridiculously short, only comprising about a week's time.  It's roughly 1/4 the total length of the original, and it has about the same fraction of potential endings.<br /><br />The only bright side is that a few of the new scenes are pretty cool, and they included a female character that was woefully ignored in the first game.<br /><br />Unless the four new scenes or the story really interest you that much, I would avoid this game like the plague.	2011-10-05

As a +/- 20-year user, I have been continually amazed at its vast capabilities, as well as Intuit's ability to keep it more or less user friendly.  The other great thing is that the help menus and directions actually correspond to the software and the problem you are having.  And if you really get stuck, QB techs are amazingly well-trained.  I've gotten myself into some real doozies with payroll, and they have been able to fix it every time.  I really can't say anything bad about 2011.  However, you should explore extremely carefully before you move up to 2013.  That's a whole new ballgame.	2012-12-15

This takes a standard microphone, and allows you to interface with your computer via USB.<br /><br />The program doesn't come with a hardcopy of instruction, but does a decent job of educating you internally. If you're not real computer or recording savey, you may find it a little cumbersome. However... you're probably going to have to be a little savey to record your stuff on any program.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with what this program offers for the money.	2010-04-25

As was stated in a previous review, there's no real instruction, no opportunity for practice, and no games whatsoever (and the review that said there were games is flat out wrong...there's not).  I'm going to call the company and ask if I can return it because I'm so annoyed.  This is awful enough for a kid that is really good at math and enjoys it, I can't even imagine ways in which this would be useful for a student who is struggling and looking for a tutorial.

I've been using it exclusively for many years and am very satisfied with my choice (over Quicken). <br /> <br />Some key points: <br />- If you have a previous version and are experiencing slow performance, this version is much improved. <br />- The Lifetime Planner is a great tool.  I have used it to lay out my long term plan, which helps me make better decisions in the short term.  In my research, I've read that the Money feature is much more robust and valuable than the Quicken version.  I'd recommend researching this feature on a product description page (Amazon or Microsoft) for more info. <br />- Budgeting and reporting tools are solid.  Not much left to want here. <br /> <br />Overall a great product.  The performance increase was worth the upgrade and the Lifetime Planner feature is the deal-breaker for me personally in terms of choosing between this product and Quicken.	2006-09-19

I have used Turbotax for 10 years and have generally been satified. This year the software would not allow me to \\"activate\\" the software over the internet and all I received was a message informing me that the multi digit product number had already been used to \\"activate\\" a copy of this program on another computer. Tech support was useless and could not understand that this was Turbotax's problem and not mine. The only solution they could offer was to return the product to the place of purchase and hope that the replacement copy has also not been compromised. This is not a good way to keeep customers. I pity the poor consumer who purchases a copy on April 14, 2003 and finds himself in the same situation.  If Turbotax thought it was useful to add this \\"feature\\", it could have at least sealed the boxes so the product activation number could not be \\"stolen\\".   Turbotax needs to resolve this issue asap or they won't need to worry about piracy-- all of Turbotax's prior customers will switch to Taxcut or other tax software you can actually use without undergoing an FBI investigation.	2002-12-25

For me, I don't have kids and am just looking for virus protection and stuff like that. I want net security that does its job without bothering me. Once in a while, I'll run a scan, but that's about it. Beyond that, I just want to update it once a year and not think about it. For my current HP computer, I have always used Trend Micro, and so far, things have gone pretty smoothly. In fact, this latest update to Internet Security Pro 3.0 was the easiest update yet, I think. I simply put in the disk and did the usual procedure, accepting the terms, clicking \\"next\\" now and then, restarting, updating and running the first check. I'm sure it all took under 30 minutes. Very easy if you follow the simple instructions, which are basically to make sure you don't have any windows open and just insert the disc and go on with what I've described. Of course, as I mentioned, this was an upgrade for me from the same brand. I was also a little unsure about getting this one because of the \\"Pro\\" in the title. It sounded like it was for businesses/offices or something, but I think it just means this is a really thorough program. Anyway, as I said, so far, everything has been really great with it, despite my operating on Vista still. Nothing has slowed down or seems different at all, and when I instruct it to, it runs its updates and scans quickly without disturbing me.	2009-11-16

I regret to say that Kaspersky, in my experience, is the worst.     Maybe it's just me. I'm not an IT professional, but I'm also not stupid. Nevertheless this thing has certainly got the better of me.     I just can't believe how cumbersome and annoying this program is. It's been nearly two months since I bought this and hardly a day goes by when I'm not handicapped by the use of this software. Yes, I paid good money so I'm reluctant to cut my loses and go back to one of the others.     Safe, familiar internet sites are crashed, mid use. \\"Training\\" seems to go on forever, but never seems to stick or be learned. Resources are hijacked. Programs, some which I've used for years, now fail to load. Pop ups appear over and over, the same ones, and don't go away. Why?     I guess I could set security levels lower, given the myriad options which are provided, and that would allow me to operate more smoothly. So then, logically speaking, I should shut off Kaspersky entirely, that would allow me smooth sailing, right? But wouldn't that lower my protection? I guess. I have no idea, the program offers scant little guidance. You're really on your own, just guessing at how to set it up.     I'm assuming that Kaspersky offers \\"security\\" and \\"protection\\"-- that's what it says on the box-- but so would shutting off my computer entirely. That's logical. And it's also ridiculous. So what am I supposed to do in order to allow the efficient use of my computer and internet serices? Kaspersky is not helpful: the manual is meeger and tech support (email only) is scant and response time is slow.     I'm sure there are some geeks out there who think that Kaspersky is just the best (and not all of them work for them). I'm not one of them. I just like to use my computer, not spend hours a day wrestling with my protection software. If you're like me, this product is not for you.     Not recommended.	2008-04-26

Amazon's editorial review describes Photoshop Elements as being a \\"barer bones\\" version of Photoshop 7.0, the $600 program used by professionals.  It's true that there are a few advanced features in Photshop that didn't make into Elements, but for the vast majority of amateurs, Elements has everything you need.  It's far superior to the \\"lite\\" versions of software that are often bundled with digital cameras in both its interface and its features. (And if you want what Adobe left out, buy \\"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2\\", available  from Amazon.)  Furthermore, it accepts many of the add-on tools (\\"plug-ins\\") that work in Photoshop 7.0 so you can expand its functionality.  The manual is OK and the help screens are good, and there are several good books you can buy to teach you the subtleties of digital image editing and of Elements.  There's everything here to satisfy the beginner and the experienced amateur as well.  Five stars for ease of use, features, expandability and value.	2003-07-20

Intuit says &quot;The growing popularity of TurboTax products over the past several years has created the need to help ensure TurboTax is used in accordance with the license agreement. Improved technology has given us a way to implement product activation that is quick, simple, and unobtrusive while protecting customer privacy.&quot;  Microsoft says the same thing with their Windows Product Activation.  This does not stop piracy.  It merely gives software crackers more funtime developing a work-around for these products.  Currently, I have found over thirty workarounds that would allow someone who has legitimately purchased Turbo Tax for him/herself, to put it on two or more computers.  I have six in my house and there are times I may want to work on my taxes on another computer rather than the one on which I originally installed the software.  Well, a key generator and a tweak in the registry is all I needed and is all anyone needs to work around Product Activation.<br />I do not like what Intuit has resorted to.  I do not make copies of theirs or any other product and merely &quot;pass it out.&quot;  But when I buy a product for myself ALONE and I have more than one machine for personal or family use, I have no problem cracking the codes myself and thumb my nose at those who make ten times more money than me and use their product to find all the loopholes to get out of paying any taxes!<br />As long as there are those who can produce the work-arounds, I guess I will continue to use Turbo Tax.  Besides, it's the thrill of &quot;the chase.&quot;	2003-01-10

When I had my company in Florida (from 1994 to 2005) I started using QuickbookPro around 1998 and I had no issues for many years, but I just used it to print invoices, estimates and control checking account and other investments. Minor inventory control was done manually. In 2010 the Hard Disk on my computer crashed and I called Intuit to grab a new installation code for my Quicken98 and the operator laughed in my face, said that they did not support Quicken98 for years and that I was crazy if I wanted to still use that product, when they had much more advanced ones and I should update to Quicken2010. That type of treatment made me very upset, but after two months considering what I should do, I ended up buying Quicken 2010, and I do not regret it. And generally speaking I like the format and user friendliness of Intuit products and that is why I decided to give QuickBooks Pro 2014 a shot, as I intend in the near future to open a new small business. I am not sure if I am ready to use the payroll feature immediately, but I intent to try.<br />I received this package and immediately installed the QuickBooks Pro 2014 part of it. It was straight forward. No flaws. It was a very quick installation process. After entering data for a fictitious company I was able to create items, services and customers and then, invoices. Although it has been 8 years since last time I used QuickBook Pro, I was back to speed in no time. Overall I am very pleased with this software and I know it has all the features I need to have the job of controlling my small business done. Probably I will try the payroll feature in the next 2 to 4 months and I will be back here to share my experience.<br /><br />Amazon.com was kind enough to provide this product for me through their Vine Program for reviewing and I was not requested to provide a positive review. Opinions expressed here are my own.wn.	2013-11-23

Most of those years included some form of business income, requiring a Schedule C to be filed. TurboTax Home and Business is a terrific product, taking you from gathering documents, to educating you about the tax code and recent changes, to data entry, to electronic filing. It's the whole package. <br /> <br />One year, we used an accountant to prepare our taxes, because of a particularly unusual income situation with complicated tax implications. In the amount of time that it took me to write down by hand all the information requested on the accountant's form, I could have typed everything into TurboTax and had my taxes filed. Plus, TurboTax is less than the $250 average tax preparation bill. And that year I really missed the tax education I usually get by going step-by-step through TurboTax, giving me tax saving strategies for the following year. <br /> <br />Faster. Cheaper.

It's our corporate VOIP, messaging, and hunt-me-down system that ensures our people can reach out to anyone without difficulty including those who are travelling - all at a price point that cannot be beaten. We've cut our roaming costs by about 90% and our long-distance costs by about 50% since we've put this system into use. We also find that the ability to conference in both internal colleagues and external clients easily is a huge advantage. We were previously heavy users of Global Crossing's on-demand conferencing system which was more costly and less flexible with far fewer individual featuers for each user. The addition of Toktumi as Line2 for iPhone is an advantage for only a portion of our users as we are essentially a Blackberry shop.    Quality: Our experience with Toktumi/Line2 is that it works great over either landlines or when the other users are Toktumi users, however when someone on the call is using a cellphone the call quality drops noticeably and precipitously to the extent the call is not feasible. When all users are landline or Tokumi based the call quality is better than pure landline calls.    Adaptor: We use the adpator within the office environment on each user's desk attached to their desktop or laptops. When we are on the orad we use Toktumi softphone on laptops or route calls to peoples cell phones. We have had no issues with the adpators, set up is simple plug and play, and the adpators work as advertised.    Conclusion: Great tool and application, not without some call quality issues, however we have found Skype and Google Voice have poorer quality -- ultimately you get what you pay for, and for corproate users or individuals with a business to run and operate we prefer Toktumi to other providers.	2010-04-08

I'm an avid PC-gamer, and have a host of games, going all the way back to MS-DOS and Windows95. I thought I was getting a real bargain when I purchased Windows 8 Pro at Best Buy in January '13 for \\"only\\" $70. (What a waste of money that has turned out to be)!!<br /><br />Virtually every game that I've tried to install on my high-end quad-core machine just produces an error message right-off-the-bat in this new version of Windows, saying, \\"This program has compatibility issues\\". Supposedly, you can go in as the computer's administrator and make the program run under some earlier version of Windows, in which it worked perfectly for you in the past (such as a lot of my games, which ran just fine under Windows XP SP3). It's just an illusionary promise, a way of making you think that Microsoft is actually on your side, and is trying to help you; when - in fact - all they want to do is use their muscle to totally control the gaming community, and have no care whatsoever that they're totally screwing you in the process. If you're thinking of buying Windows 8, you'd better be prepared to buy all new software, including your games!<br /><br />Even the \\"Games for Windows\\" games that I'd bought and had been happily playing on XP or Vista (such as Bioshock and Fallout 3, to name a couple... even the newer \\"Fallout New Vegas\\" won't install and play on my machine now. If it's a non-Microsoft-related game, you might as well forget it. If it's a Microsoft \\"Games for Windows\\" game, you'll find that you now are forced by Microsoft to go online and create a Microsoft \\"LiveX\\" (X-box) account (even though you, like me, may never have owned an X-Box console in the first place, and live way out in the middle of nowhere in the mountains, in \\"dialup-only land\\", where there's no cable-tv, no cellphone signal, and certainly no means of having a braodband internet connection; with no ability to ever play any game online at all. To add insult to injury, when you bend-over to their demands, preparing to get screwed, and actually create such a LiveX account, you - like me - may find that all the progress that you will ever make is to just keep getting error messages, when you try to log into this Livex system (could they actually detect that you're a dialup \\"waste of time\\", and be deliberately keeping you from logging in? Who knows... Again and again I've gotten error messages when I've tried to log-in to this damned thing, saying that there was a problem with my password. Again and again they've emailed me a link to click onto, so that I could \\"update\\" my password, which - after I'd done so, in the end just resulted in the same error message when I tried again (and again and again and again) to log in.<br /><br />As for me, I'm going back to some earlier version of Windows that actually WORKED; at least until I can look into buying a Playstation, or installing Linux, or or maybe some combination of the two...	2013-02-07

After merely one day out of the box these are clear and distinct reasons why you should HOLD OFF until Intuit managers to hire developers that actually appreciate running a business rather than what appears to be the latest & greatest young & hip crowd trying to create the \\"cool look.\\"<br /><br />1. In their infinite wisdom, address boxes are ridiculously small. One must scroll left & right to see the full address. (Oddly, the left half of the \\"real estate\\" of any given window displays an enormous title ie. Purchase Order, Sales Receipt with more than half of the left side of the window with nothing but blank space.) Do you think you could have made the super cool address windows at least wide enough to show addresses both foreign & domestic? [SOLUTION: ALLOW THE USER TO CHANGE THE WINDOW SIZES AND GET RID OF THE 30pt. FONT SIZE.]<br /><br />2. The font & row height is much larger & what could easily be seen in one window now requires scrolling just to see the full data set. [SOLUTION:  ALLOW THE USER TO ADJUST THE ROW HEIGHT AND ADJUST THE FONT SIZE USED.]<br /><br />3. The colors of the Bill, PO, Invoice windows cannot be changed even in R6. The only color change is in the top title bar of any given window. [SOLUTION: RETURN THE FUNCTION TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COLORS INSIDE THE WINDOWS.]<br /><br />4. The height & width is no longer adjustable to allow multiple windows to appear on the screen resulting in having to bounce back & forth between windows just to see the data. What a pain & waste of time! We used to show Bill with Purchase Order below and Sales Receipt to the right. Now PO and Bill overlap probably caused by problem (innovation) #2 above. [SOLUTION: ALLOW THE USER TO ACTUALLY RESIZE THE WINDOW SO THERE IS NO OVERLAP.]<br /><br />5. Who's idea was it to take the ship functions from the main windows and move them to another tab? Total waste of time clicking another tab. [SOLUTION: MAKE THE USE OF TABS FULLY ADJUSTABLE BY THE USER. ALLOW THE USER TO CREATE WANTED TABS, MOVE FUNCTIONS AND DELETE TABS.]<br /><br />6. In that fancy, new helper bar that sticks out on the right side of every window when RECENT TRANSACTIONS are displayed...ACTUALLY OPEN THE TRANSACTION when clicking on it RATHER than opening the Transaction Journal for that transaction in a separate window, THUS creating more busy work having to click the Transaction Journal to open the actual transaction window I desired opening IN THE FIRST PLACE!<br /><br />7. Suggestion: Allow a Purchase Order to be created from the Sales Receipt and/or Invoice and then link them and provide a menu button for it in the main window of the PO and SR so that I can open an SR from the PO and vice versa without having to perform an advanced search. When doing this, be sure to add a checkbox for each product in the Sales Receipt so we might create multiple PO from one Sales Receipt. For the Internet age where there is much drop-shipping, this really makes sense.<br /><br />8. Suggestion: Allow Purchase Orders for a given vendor to be CONDENSED. Real life situation - Products can be marked in the shopping cart software to create PO in QB upon import of the order. If 10 people place 10 separate orders for 10 items from a Vendor from whom we must acquire product, we don't want to look at every order in the shopping cart system to see each product and the quantity ordered so that a full PO can be created for that distributor. If we could merely set all products from that Vendor to automatically create a purchase order, with the new QB REALLY COOL, SMART AND INNOVATIVE PO FUNCTION, we could merely choose from a checkbox list to combine all 10 of those PO into one and save immense time.	2013-04-28

I am so glad that I chose the Logos system.  It amount of time it saves me on a regular basis is lifesaving.    I am a seminary student who will be going into the Army Chaplaincy.  As a seminary student, this is such a tremendous help with original language work.  Word studies and parsing is just a mouse click away.  This is such a great help.  As a future chaplain who is facing a likely deployment to Iraq I know that I can't bring many books with me.  I can however, bring logos.  Therefore, I am building up my library electronically so I can always take it with me wherever the ministry takes me.    The most amazing this about this software is its ability to integrate your library into your work.  When I look up a passage (say John 4) it gives me my preferred bible (ESV) and then it runs through my library to find where John 4 is referenced in all my electronic books.  I click on a commentary (like the Word Biblical Commentary), and it takes me right to the section on John 4.  With one click I can see every book in my library that has my passage referenced.  What a huge time saver.    This product is truly great and not once have I ever regretted my investment.  I am learning new feature and how to do new things on this software every time I use it.  They have thought of everything.  Thanks logos for a great product.	2007-11-30

The software had issues, but I got around those, and it became a useful, if temperamental friend.  I am now looking for software which can handle HD video and naturally turned to Premiere Elements 8.<br /><br />Oh boy, I'm glad I didn't buy this on trust.  I have not seen such a shocking piece of software in the 20 or so years I have been using a PC.  This 'thing' fails on just about every front, to the extent that it is completely unusable.  If Amazon would have allowed '0' stars, this would get it.  It just does not work to any extent.  It crunches along, hangs, freezes, and from time to time catches up with what you are doing, but all of this happens at a pace which is startlingly slow.  But there's worse - having installed the trial edition, the uninstall then sets about decimating your hard drive, uninstalling all other Adobe apps on its way.  Thank goodness I had my system backed up, because that's what it took to get me back on the road.<br /><br />A word of criticism for software reviews and reviewers from other sites.  Each one unanimously praises this waste of magnetism, which only suggests to me that they have only ever read the pdf flyer and not actually used it.  I couldn't get a single one of the new features of this software to work; not at all, not to any extent.  Like a a gremlin in a fairy tale, this thing huffs and puffs and abjectly refuses to communicate.  Look around at the other user reviews for this on Amazon - can a million other users be wrong???  By the way I am using a PC with an Intel Quad Core 8400 processor, 4GB memory, and Windows 7; not exactly a slouch.<br /><br />I have been testing other editing software, and for sure will be ditching Adobe for video editing.  Each of the other packages I've been testing have worked as indicated, have been reliable, and offer functionality equivalent too, or better than, that of Premiere Elements.  This only re-inforces the poor quality that Adobe has released on the world.  At the moment I'm considering Cyberlink PowerDirector 8; Magix Movie Edit Pro 15 +, and Corel VideoStudio Pro X2.  I would rank them in that order, and would strongly suggest that any one considering video editing software look at any of those three packages.  They will probably work, unlike Adobe Premiere Elements 8.of Premiere Elements.  This only re-inforces the poor quality that Adobe has released on the world.

I've been using Webroot for about four or five years, including when the product was Prevx. Webroot acquired Prevx and eventually replaced their Webroot flagship product with the Prevx product (you can do an Internet search if you want more info). I'll focus this review on my experience with the company and product.<br /><br />What I like about it ... other reviews have covered the positive features well. For me, the fast scan is the best feature.<br /><br />Regarding using with other security programs ... when using this program, I've always used this program with another computer-based security program, in the past with the Zone Alarm full suite (which I eventually had too many issues with after using over ten years), then with Norton Internet Security Suite 2012 and now Norton 360 2013. While I am not a tech, I started in computer sales in 1985, and software sales in 1993, and would put myself in the intermediate category. From this level, I have not seen any significant issues running with another computer-based security program. Could there be something on a much more technical level where there is a conflict? That is possible.  Now, the Complete and Internet Security Plus versions include a \\"firewall\\", password protection, etc. So, that opens up more opportunity for conflicts.  But, I think I have only experienced one virus in the last five years. So, this dual approach has worked fairly well for me.  In the Prevx days, they actually positioned the product this way.<br /><br />Regarding support ... One criteria I look at with software is what support does the company offer, and when. Webroot only offers technical support for consumers from M-F, 7am to 6 pm MT. They have sales there later at night and on the weekends, but not support. In this day and time that is very weak. I've experienced both quick phone call responses and VERY long wait times (over thirty minutes).<br /><br />In short, I would not use this as my primary malware protection, but like it as anextra layer of protection.  What happens if you have a virus and cannot connect to Webroot? It is Cloud-based ... you better have a plan.  (You can read my reviews under Complete and Internet Security Plus of why I would use Webroot \\"AntiVirus\\" over these.)	2013-07-10

It was a big hog of my PC, slowed everything down big time when a scan was running and also every time updates came in. Even when no scan was running it slowed my PC. It had very annoying registery pop-ups too. I had Norton Antivirus for several years but because of the bad reviews for the 07 version I went with CA. CA Antivirus is so much better. Doesn't hog the PC like McAfee. Runs smooth. It would have been nice if a firewall had been included.	2007-03-12

I'm a long time Quicken user of various 'Basic' versions. I bought the 'Starter Ed - 2009' and it's all down hill from there. Not only does it not convert earlier data from most earlier versions, it doesn't tell you that until you start installing. And then it doesn't give you a clear path to 'upgrade' to the appropriate product. When finally informed by the 'Quicken Community' forum how upgrading is done (through an obscure menu in 'Starter') then you find out the total cost is $20 more than if they had guided you to the appropriate product in the first place. I couldn't really complain directly to the company because their 'contact' format basically limits you to the options 'Support' wants to consider - and the site response is very slow anyway - and then I got a message that my complaint was never sent due to some glitch. Thank God I kept my earlier Q version on a laptop and made it through tax season - it could have been a disaster had I installed it to replace the version I was using. And then I started reading some of the horror stories surrounding unsuccessful conversion attempts. Intuit finally outdid Microsoft!	2009-03-18

The advantage of the Mac version, though, are the 3 licenses that come with it. This is fantastic - it allows you to install the package on 3 different Macs legally. So, if you have more than one computer in the house (and a lot of us do, now), you can have a copy on your desktop G4 or G5, one on your iBook or PowerBook, etc.<br />All the bells and whistles are included, so if you are experienced with the functions of Office X, this will be a brainless migration for you.<br />It is missing some abilities to translate some files though, which is true of the professional versions as well. It does not handle AppleWorks, OpenOffice, or even MSWorks files very well. This can be a problem if your school is standardized on products other than Microsoft. Of course, this is a common issue with MS suite - to which they always answer &quot;Then you should standardize on Microsoft...&quot; Typical.	2004-01-23

The bottom line is that I've been using this product since version 1 and would now be lost without it. The learning curve is short and the product's interface is intuitive and easy to use.  If I'm away from the program for weeks or even months at a time, I have no problem picking up where I left off.  Compared to some notation software I've used in the past, this product is a blessing.  Lyricist is not notation software so if you're looking to notate your songs, again, this product isn't for you, however, if you're like me - a songwriter who just needs to chord chart songs and arrangements, polish off lyrics and rhymes, archive the song for later use, and then go off to develop another song idea, then this product was made for you.  Lennon and McCartney probably would have loved this tool since they, like many songwriters out there work the same way.  On the other hand, if you are one of those people who are looking for a product that writes the song for you, then Lyricist is not for you.      Lyricist let's you write songs using your own methods, and, for me, for the last 35 years, that's using a guitar and/or keboard armed with a pen and paper.  In a songwriting session, I'll usually come up with an idea and develop it.  If it starts to work, I might write a verse or two, a chorus, bridge, mark it up with some chord symbols, and rough out an arrangement.  By the end of the session, I'll usually have a few pieces of paper with lots of scribble, but, somewhere in that scrible is the next mega Billboard hit.  This is where Lyricist shines.  When the session ends, at my leisure, I'll take my idea from paper and type it into Lyricist.  Lyricist really is a songwriter's wordprocessor with all the features you'd expect, copy/paste, speller, thesaurus, rhyming dictionary, chord wizards, and automated transposition.  In the end, you might even want to convert your arrangement to the Nashville Number System, and the Lyricist Transposition feature doesthat in a breeze.  Usually within an hour, I have some very neat polished lyrics, a song chordchart and arrangement in the desired key, and a printout of the song.  At this time, I'm ready to go on to the next idea or keep working on the existing song.  Either way, I'm secure in knowing that Lyricist has catagorized and archived my compositions in a safe secure database located on my PC.      Hey, I'm not saying that Lyricist couldn't be improved.  Personally, I'd like to see support for bass notes over chords and support for alternate tunings, but, I can still do 90% of my songs using the current Lrycist featureset.  To my good fortune, VSS has promised to include the above features in V4, so, after that's done, I don't think I'll have anything to complain about.  I can't thank VSS enough for giving me the best friend a songwriter could ever have.  I love this product.    Paul Olito  Walrus Business Group   walrus44@vsplanet.com	2008-08-22

After some significant research, I concluded there was no real alternative. When I first installed the 2010 version, it took a bit of time but it worked with some tweaking.<br /><br />I was perfectly content continuing to use the 2010 version until I found out what I should have realized three years ago. The support for online account downloads would be ending soon. My first action was to begin checking the Amazon reviews of the 2013 product and I became very concerned. Given the size of my file (60 Meg) and the number of accounts (73 historical accounts and 19 active current accounts including brokerage, checking, savings, 401k, IRA, Stock Options and Credit Card accounts) I was very concerned about what the 2013 upgrade process would be like. After a couple of weeks of reading reviews and doing further research by reading posts on the Quicken user forum, I purchased the 2013 Premier version. Good price and quick delivery but I had no real confidence that this would go well having given the experience of many users.<br /><br />I did a standard uninstall through Windows (XP). After that, I attempted to use the Quicken uninstall file available online (and recommended by some users to eliminate all remnants of the old version). But that didn’t result in anything productive. It simply told me there was no version of Quicken found on the machine. I made several backups of my Quicken current file and my archived historical files. All were copied to CD (just in case). I also ran reports and printed account balances for all active accounts. I also am fanatical about backing up my entire Hard Drive so I knew if I needed to, I could go back to a prior hard drive status. I also was fortunate enough to still have my 2010 CD installation disk in case I needed to reinstall the old version. My 2010 file was not password protected. Given what I have read, some users with password protected files have had significant difficulty.<br /><br />I ordered the CD. Once I uninstalled the 2010 product, I installed the 2013 product. The install process was relatively quick, but since there have been so many upgrades since the CD was first issued (10 updates?), the upgrade process seemed to take forever. In fact, I would have aborted the process since I thought my machine was dead. But there was no way to abort it without simply shutting the machine down. I patiently waited for it to complete and after a solid 10 minutes, it finally completed. One small gripe here is that there is no indication on the screen telling you where you are in the upgrade process. At a minimum it should let you know how many upgrades it is downloading and how many have been installed. Unfortunately, there was no feedback whatsoever. It looked like the machine was simply frozen (but it wasn’t). At some point, it asked if it should import and convert my existing 2010 file. Thankfully, this conversion was flawless. All account balances were compared to the balances I recorded before I uninstalled the 2010 version. I was quite relieved and very pleased.<br /><br />I have not tried any of the mobile features and I don’t intend to since I don’t need these features. I don’t see much new here in terms of the features I use. I don’t use the budgeting tool or any planning tools. As far as the upgrade and conversion process, I’d rate this product with four stars given my results. My overall rating of four stars reflects the fact that I don’t use all of the features. There are a number of people providing advice in the user forums that the mobile features are not really ready for prime time and users should wait until the kinks are worked out of the system.<br /><br />Generally, I find Quicken is a good product. I don’t mind the mandatory upgrade every three years. I certainly understand the need for an income stream in order to keep supporting a product. What I do mind is the fact that many, many users have had issues and I can only conclude that the product was not sufficiently tested before it was put on the market.

Part of the course material was an introduction to SolidWorks.  Love at first click.      Al's lessons are well thought out and easy to follow.  I learned more from them than the classes at the college. Since they are self paced, it is very convenient to backup for anything missed or to repeat a lesson.  They will get your feet wet and get your thinking ready for the CSWA (Certified Solid Works Associate) exam.    I'm anxiously waiting for his next series of lessons.    I recommend that you have a duel monitor system for these or any CAD lessons.  Put Solid Works on your main monitor and the lessons on the secondary.	2010-08-02

This internet security suite (ISS) was installed on one of my backup laptop (Dell Inspiron running Windows 7) in Sept. 2010 when the OEM McAfee license expired.  Everything functioned smoothly but make sure a full scan is performed prior to (with existing ISS)/or during the install because McAfee may experience difficulty installing due to the presence of malwares.  A full initial scan during installation will also speed up later scans as I've found out from other online security forums.  McAfee only provides free live support for the first 30 days.  When it came to renew the McAfee license in 2011, I decided to try the AVG Internet Security 2011 which doesn't slow down the system as much, and is better at detecting malwares than the McAfee Total Protection.  That's not surprising considering the constant advancements in security softwares to counter the relentless online threats and the gamut of competitive products available.	2011-10-18

It is basically a good program, but nothing spectacular.  The &#34;help&#34; section was difficult to navigate, so each and every card took a very long time to create.  However, my end results, whether great looking or not were appreciated by those that received the cards, mainly because I took time to create something special for them.  I ran into a problem recently.  I couldn't add photos because it tells me &#34;out of memory&#34;.  I deleted all previously created cards saved and all favorites saved.  Still tells me &#34;out of memory&#34; and will not allow me to add any photos to any cards.  Could be a simple answer, but when I went to Nova Development's web page to communicate with them, I get told that they will talk to me - $10.00 a call.<br />Seriously?  I'm hoping there are still companies out there that actually want customer business and repeat business.  I had almost decided to upgrade my Greeting Card Factory.  So glad I didn't.	2014-01-02

Navigation between games is very easy, the different activities were enjoyable for the kids and the multiple levels for each activity allowed them to go at their own pace without outgrowing it too quickly. Kids can continue to play after they master all levels. We especially liked that the games provided appropriate complexity as they progressed, so the kids did not get bored with the activity as they went up the levels. The downside is the software was made long enough ago that it's not compatible with newer windows operating systems.

This is based off of just completing 42 hours of game play running through my first single player run at the campaign.  I found the setting excellent, feudal Japan makes for a perfect choice for Total War, the weapon options are well suited to the 3D battles that ensue, and the resulting simplification benefits the game from previous Total Wars.  The art design, graphics, lay out of buttons and commands, everything, all works together for a common theme that allows the player to soak in the atmosphere of playing the role of a clan leader seeking to take over and become shogun.    Technically I've heard discussion about issues, I've had none.  Game performance was just fine.  The wait between turns can be a tad annoying, it takes awhile for all the clans to do their thing, but this can be turned off so you don't see the moves.    The turn based campaign portion of the game is the fun part of civ coupled with the option to fight on a gorgeous 3D battlefield anytime you like, and when you don't, you can auto-resolve the battle.    The need to run an economy has the right level of complexity and decision making necessary to offer meaningful choices that impact your drive for domination, as does diplomacy that implements an honor system that has real impact based on the decisions of how you interact with other clans.    And the part that wins me over completely, in the campaign I fought as the Date, which is a clan starting on the far right of the map, so I spent much of the game marching and building left, as I did, all of my decisions had implications, and upon taking Kyoto I had the fight of my life, which I only survived because of diplomatic decisions about key allies I maintained through marriage, hostage exchange and money and trade.  It all worked great, until some of the clans against me sailed down the coast and took two of my back provinces I needed as part of the victory conditions, so here I am, Shogunate, yet I've not won.  Because the AI was smart enough to sail down the opposite coast with armies and basically flank me.  This battle to win has a deadline, I had until 1575 to make it.  As a result of these two clans flanking me, I had exactly 3 years in game time to march half the length of japan, take those two provinces back while still holding on to 23 other provinces including Kyoto.  Holding my breath to the very last battle, I take back in a Pyrrhic the last province I need to win, and this was in the fall of 1575, two turns away from failure.    In summary, I've had more fun playing this one campaign in this strategy game than any I've played since Combat Mission (a reference perhaps lost on most, but there it is).  I highly recommend this game.	2011-04-02

There are, however, significant deficiencies in the options available, the method of working, and various other features if you compare it to the 'granddaddy' QB for Windows.   A significant problem is that you cannot always type the name or number of an account number and have QB find the account automatically.  This makes entering transactions quite painful if you have a lot of account numbers and have to search and click for them.   QB for MAC just needs to do and be everything that QB for Windows is.    The help file should also be complete.  It lacks many topics that are clearly part of QB for MAC.   For better or worse, in business MACs are gaining space.  Let's just do our work, Intuit, and create a product that is equivalent to the Windows product...or better!     FYI, the server-based product does not operate the way it was explained to us by Intuit.  In the end, in order not to have an additional unattended machine needing to be backed up, we declined to use the server option.  Seems quite complex for a simple desire to have QB files resident on a server of one type or another.  In addition, when we purchased, almost no one at Intuit support could assist us in setup.	2011-05-31

Today I spent 53 minutes on the phone with their support agents. Long story short, they don't know the H&R Block at Home product.

I had to direct them to a software screen to prove that yes, you were supposed to be able to import from various versions of Quicken because they insisted I could only use Quicken 2008 for 2009 taxes. Mine is 2007 and clearly listed as an option on their \\"Smart Import\\" screen.

Over the years it has become more and more of everything except simple and rock solid. This is now a beast which rears its ugly head at all the worst moments.<br />If it has not crashed on you yet, it will one day. So what? Every application crashes once in a while, you say? Perhaps. But Quicken has a magical ability to take a crash and turn it into corrupted data. Once the data file has a little corruption in it everything just gets worse and worse. Crashes come more frequently and then suddenly a checking or credit card account tells you it is &quot;out of balance&quot; and a prior period needs to be re-reconciled. Ok, but when you try to do this it either will not let you or it appears in every way to be correct, but insists it is not. At that point the only way out involves significant reentry of data OR an expensive submission of your file to Intuit tech support for &quot;cleaning.&quot; To top it all off, your confidence in your data is shaken badly. All you can think of is the possibility of ever needing to &quot;redo the work again&quot; another time.<br />I love the Quicken I remember, and this product probably still is that good until things go wrong. Once wronged, however, it is more than torturous to recover from.<br />If you proceed, and you probably will because Intuit has a virtual lock on the personal finance market, you must be careful to back up after EVERY session. Even more critical is the need to return to the last clean backup immediately IF your file EVER crashes. Do NOT ever continue to use a crashed file or you will be very sorry. Very sorry.<br />The truly disheartening fact is Intuit continues to sell us an application containing the same bugs in version after version. They add a handful of features each year to tempt us to part with another chunk of change, but we keep seeing the same pimples and quirks carried forward. Many of us update our copy each year not toget any new features, but in the hopes they actually fixed our least favorite bug. All too often they have not, but we keep hoping.	2003-11-15

I don't find working with taxes easy, and this makes the best out of a bad job. Being a Brit living in the States, I do find that the way it deals with assets in another country can be a bit clunky and not intuitive, but the support online usually gets me through it. I find this is an good tool to help me get through a necessary evil. Nobody is ever going to say 'Yay, time to do my taxes, I get to buy Turbotax', but this is worth it.	2014-01-06
US	28853139	R3IPP63BQGV9WE	B004JMQM3Y	568342330	Black Mirror 3: Final Fear	Software	4	7	8	N	N	Always great...up until the end	Black Mirror III is almost the same game as Black Mirror II as far as gameplay (3rd person, point and click) and variety of puzzles are concerned. The third game suffers because Adrian/Darren never leaves Willow Creek and there are few locations to travel to within the world, which can be tiring after a while treading through the same scenes over and over again. However, Adrien's gradual descent into madness and his ever present sardonic humor make for an entertaining game. BMIII is playable even if you have not played 1 or 2, but some of the references might not make sense and the endings of the two previous games will be ruined.    Visuals: 3/5, I have to wonder what the game developers were thinking on this entry. BMII had vibrant color and beautiful scenery. BMIII is ALWAYS dark, drizzly and gray. Some scenes are so dark (visually speaking) that I could not separate the characters from the backdrop without cranking the brightness way up on my monitor. The ever present darkness made the game atmospheric but, when coupled with odd camera angles, difficult to play. Still, the woods are genuinely creepy and the cutscenes are free of bugs and excellent!    Sound: 5/5, Still as great or better than BMII. The sound as always been this franchise's strongpoint. New to this game is a sound cue that plays when a crucial plot advancement is made. It makes it easier to know when to go back and look for newly activated hotspots. However, the default ambient and music settings are louder than the dialogue, which makes the intro scenes hard to follow (change it before playing).     Voice: 4/5, Adrian's voice can start out being annoying, but the only voice acting I found grating was the really bad Irish accent the Inspector was sporting. I kind of wished Adrien/Mordred would have killed him so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore (and you do have to talk to him many times).    Gameplay/Puzzles: 4/5, The puzzles in BMIII are mostly inventory or logic related. There is one semi-maze, trap the shade puzzle near the end which is the most difficult puzzle in the game, but it is nowhere near as difficult the BMII finale puzzle. The game comes with its own walkthrough if needed, but the most difficulty will just be determining what you need to do to advance the plot because gameplay is very LINEAR. The most annoying aspect is you will know what to do next but the game will not let you pick up something before a plot cue (usually talking to someone). However, Adrien's journal provides helpful hints (without giving too much away this time like BMII). In the final two acts, you can control two characters, but the final result is kind of cumbersome (I kept killing the second player in the maze because I would forget about him).    The ending/What was that?: 3/5, Okay, both 2 and 3 have built up Darren as a character and advanced his plight to almost melodrama status over about 20 hours of gameplay. The guy is possessed, people get killed, mystic visions, blood and gore all around. The ending is the epitome of anticlimactic. It's like saying, \\"Nice job Adrian. Now let's go have tea and krumpets and emote with our journal.\\" There are still numerous plot holes. Such as, \\"Who's the guy in the drawer?\\" or \\"What about the suicide girl in Biddeford from BMII?\\"    Overall 4/5, It was humorous and entertaining, but the ending had much to be desired and also smacks of a sequel.	2011-04-23

I had never used either product so I wasn't certain which one to buy. I checked out the Amazon reviews on each product and couldn't make a final decision because the reviews seemed so polarized; some people loved one or both products while others hated one or both products with a passion.<br /><br />I finally settled on ABBYY Finereader 11 Pro Edition simply because PC Magazine had given it an Editors Choice Award and had not given one to Omnipage 18.<br /><br />So far I'm quite happy with ABBYY Finereader. I'm doing research and using a scanner or my digital camera to take scans/photos of books and articles and then using the OCR software to convert the scans/photos to text. ABBYY Finereader has done that very well so far. Using a digital camera to take photos of book pages often results in an image that appears curved or curled at the edges. ABBYY Finereader seems to handle that image distortion well.<br /><br />The software user interface is also pretty intuitive and, as a first time user, I found it fairly easy to figure out how to use this program to accomplish what I wanted it to do.<br /><br />On the downside, I had a few minor problems getting an installation code for the product from ABBYY. It took three attempts before I managed to download an installation code. It also took several attempts to register the product with ABBYY. As computer related irritants go, these are fairly minor but they're problems ABBYY should look at fairly seriously.<br /><br />I've never used Omnipage 18 so I can't compare the two programs against each other, but I'm happy with ABBYY Finereader so far.	2012-11-09

I used a previous version of GoBack on a Windows 98 machine, and it worked as promised, saving my kiester on a few occasions. So when I saw GoBack 3 claimed compatability with XP, I bought it, thinking it would give me better security.<br />Think again! It seemed to install OK, so I went online to register. Roxio's website said I should download their free update, which I dutifully did, and installed. Then, when I re-booted, the computer stalled on the first black screen with a disk read error message. After trying every trick I know, I realized that my only hope of saving my precious data was to put a new hard drive in the computer, install XP on it, and then try to recover my data. $... later, I found to my dismay that even though both of my old drives showed up in BIOS, Windows couldn't see either one! A very knowledgable computer tech at a local store rolled his eyes when I described the problem, and said that they don't even try to recover data from drives messed up by GoBack. His only suggestion was to try Partition Magic ($...) to recover the data. Long story short, it worked, but I had to harvest all the data, and re-format my old drives to remove the last vestages of GoBack, and then re-build my software environment from scratch.<br />This software has cost me over $... and many hours of my time.<BR>DON'T USE IT WITH WINDOWS XP!	2002-12-12

First, I have to say I love the MS Money product(s) and I would give it 5 stars to any new user. I use a lot of the features, but not all of them of course. Of the features that I use, I have yet to see a major reason/difference between the 2003 and 2004 version.The one interesting feature is the on-line credit report from Experian. Once you register, you get their credit score (not to be confused with a FICO score) and credit report. That was kinda cool.<br />I purchased from another store, so I'm not able to answer the main rebate question from Amazon that I had - Are there 2 $$ in-box rebates? However, there is one additional rebate that I did not know about. In the box there is a card to get a free year's subscription to Money (or Fortune or Business 2.0) for a year. Or, you can mail in the card for a $$ rebate/refund.<br />In summary, I would not  get 2004 Deluxe if you have 2003 Deluxe. Unless, you get it a great price (like free with rebates, which may happen at tax time). Or, you really need the credit report and can justify this feature for the cost.	2003-07-27

Over the years I've tried various Corel offerings, every time I'm excited by the possibilities and neat options listed on the box, then frustrated and disappointed by the end results. It's not that the program is bad necessarily, just that it seems it's not very intuitive, it's slow loading, laggy, or simply the end result is not very impressive. There always seems to be a program by a different manufacturer that's slightly more expensive, but does a better job.<br /><br />Paintshop fits into this category perfectly. Again, here is a Corel product that is less expensive than the competition, but just doesn't deliver enough of a good thing to make the price difference worth it.<br /><br />I use Photoshop, yes it is horribly expensive, but it absolutely creates exactly the results I'm working towards every time. It doesn't lag or hang up, it never has issues saving files. It's a sturdy workhorse of a program.<br /><br />Corel tried to add bells and whistles to Paintshop to make it more enticing to buyers, but the base product is just not up to the standards a professional or semi-professional photo editor is looking for. I've worked with Paintshop Photo Pro off and on now for 6 months, and I haven't found anything about it that makes me want to keep it taking up space on my hard drive.<br /><br />If you do not have any other photo editing programs, you are thinking about getting more involved in photo editing, and you can find Paintshop at a heavily discounted price, it's a deal. However, if you can find a way to afford Photoshop, do it.	2011-04-28

So, I downloaded an evaluation copy and couldn't get ACT! work on my computer. I tried a couple more iterations of this and it still would not install properly. However, because of the customer friendly policy of Amazon I bought a copy of ACT! 2011 Pro anyway. I then loaded ACT! to my computer from the disk and guess what happened?

Definitely helps with a difficult to learn language	The product consists of several PC CD-ROMS, audio CD's, headset w/microphone, and instruction manuals.  Installation was fairly straightforward although product activation is required. After installation and activation, we were prompted to configure the speech recognition.  This was easy and it works surprisingly well.  The beginning lessons were concise and easy to understand.  It basically teaches you the words, you repeat them, and the speech recognition guages how well you did. This is a great way to learn because it also teaches pronunciation.  As you progress, it gets more complex and the rules more strict, just like in a class.  The immersion technique is a great approach and the accompanying visuals are great.  My son is currently studying Japanese in high school.  He's had some difficulties along the way, however he finds the lessons in this product pretty easy to follow. This is an excellent study aid for him and is already boosting his confidence for the upcoming school year. Ultimately, the learning potential depends upon the individual.  This won't teach you Japanese overnight, however if you are persistent and serious about learning the language, it would definitly be a beneficial learning aid or supplemental resource for those already studying the language.  I'll update this review at a later time to report long-term results.	2008-08-05

I mainly make greeting cards and having the ability to send the card as an ecard is great, especially with postage increasing soon.  I will now use the program to make more cards than I usually have done in the past. I like the ability to change the card format from quarter fold to half fold before you print the card. The ease of printing an envelope is a plus also. This program also has the feature of picking the type of card that you want, funny, sentimental etc and that helps to limit what cards you have to choose from instead of looking at all the cards in a category. My family is very happy with this purchase.	2005-12-25

I have had two other versions of this program in the past (which won't work on Win 7) that never forced you to register to use it.  So I went ahead and tried to register, there is no 'book' with this but gave a number on the install sheet to use for registry.  Which promptly said that it was an invalid number and refuses to let me finish installing or even use this program.  I emailed support from Encores site and have heard nothing back. So consider this basically 'theft' to make you pay for a program you can't even use.  Shame on them.	2010-10-08

And they rate BitDefender's performance among the best, often better than the better known Norton. Symantec offerings.<br /><br />All I can say is that over three years, we've had no viruses. Best for me, though, is that my laptop is getting old. The software runs in the background unobtrusively, and does not slow the computer down.

It has been many years that I have used TurboTax for my joint return.  Several years ago, after starting a new partnership in a business, we felt our taxes were going to be more complicated, and passed the task onto the corporate CPA team that prepared the company partnership documents.  Well - after paying $500 to determine we needed to pay 5 figures in taxes, I figured we'd see what TurboTax could do to help my situation the following year.  And with TurboTax last year, things went just as planned.<br /><br />Now - starting off, the first time you used TT, you will need to spend a bit of time adding in the basic (names, socials, address, business addresses...) but the following year all that will be in the memory banks, making future years so much easier.  They also will also keep a record of what documents you filed in the past and prompt you if XXX document is valid this year, etc - making it less likely to forget a form by accident.<br /><br />So the Pros:<br />* easy install - will prompt you to look for updates, which you want to do.<br />* easy navigation through the process - want to go back and change a form, just search for it<br />* save the form and return to it later<br />* review and check for errors<br />* help available!<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Well, there are no cons, as far as I am concerned.	2015-01-26

Norton anti-virus at some point was the best anti-virus program, then it started going down hill and especially when they bundled this other useless (trash-ware) Internet security components.  I am an above average computer user.  This product is not worth the money.  It is probably best to spend the money on just the anti-virus alone if that is still any good.  When I installed this program it slowed down my 550 MHz system.  If I try to send an email with an attachment it timed out (poor programing) because it scans the outgoing mail and it is also supposed to \\"train\\" its anti-spam engine, which is by the way useless, a simple OE filter catches more spam than it ever hopes to.  I have DSL so it is not a bandwidth or timeout issue like Symantec would like you to believe, it is simply that Norton acts as the mail server for your email client but acts less than that due to poor or incomplete programing. Symantec's website is not much help on this big defect in the program.  The solution that I discovered after days of trial and error is to disable the scanning of the outgoing email all together, this applies to the email scanning of outgoing messages and the filtering/training in the anti-spam options (so much for paying the extra for the Internet security features that have to be disabled in most cases unless you are just sending plain text emails.)  The timeout prevention settings provided by the program in a couple of places is ineffective (I wonder if they are just there as dummy features, because they do not seem to affect things one way or the other!)  It is sad to see another good name go down the drain; Now I wonder whether the anti-virus portion is effective or not!! <br /> <br />Once my subscription expires, I may go with eTrust's EZ Anti-virus and Zone Alarm or McAfee's anti-virus and Zone Alarm(which was the best a long time ago then became buggy once bundled in a suit, but now might have improved.)	2005-09-06

Turns out that only works for analog sources, such as your sound card. If you have a track already on CD originally from an analog source, Spin Doctor is useless for post-processing.<br />I contacted tech support and at least they confirmed up front that this was the case, instead of sending me on wild goose chases.<br />The &quot;bundled&quot; products, such as Spin Doctor and the WAV editing tool, I found in general to be not well integrated into the main product.

I have used it for several years, and before moving, ran one of their weather stations. I have a problem with them in that they used to be able for station owners to put out alerts to our customers, and then they took that away. Also, the previous version is better than the current version. I like the ability to have \\"My Stations\\", but in the old version, when you clicked on one of \\"My Stations\\", you got the full details, just like that was your home station setting. Now, you get minimal data, and to get the full information, you have to actually make the other station your Home station. It's doable, but lots of messing around, when they had it so good before. Don't know why they changed it. Too bad. Apparently, they didn't know when they had a good thing.	2005-03-01

I tried the Mac version of Quick Books with great anticipation. Installed in a flash and was able to convert QB files to and from the PC. But alas, every time I tried to enter credit card charges, it would crash. Every other feature I used seemed OK. But I use my credit card a lot for client expenses. I just can't trust my business to crash-prone software that leaves me suspect as to whether it's capturing all of my critical data. So, for Quick Books, it's back to the trusty PC version.

I was captured by Paint Shop Pro version 3.x and have been a slave to the magic of this graphical world ever since.  I have been using PSP 7.0 since it was released, so why would I upgrade to the 7.04 Anniversary Edition?  I debated, as I always do about upgrades, and finally decided to try it because of the special Bonus Package Highlights.<br />These created a provocative adventure that drew me in and stimulated that secret part of my mind where my creativity hides from the muses.  Artistic filters add intriguing dimensions to my graphic arts, and play with my fantastical imagination.  I enter the antimatter effect, and feel as if I am one of Picasso's canvases and surrealistic facets surround me.  I am not in control of this artistic journey because the sensations of unlimited possibilities lure me to the next image.<br />Coming back to reality:<br />* To install the new version all previous copies of PSP must be removed, so make sure your data is stored in a separate location from the program files.<br />* You can create photo albums that can be exported it to HTML code.<br />* The software package contains two books: Getting Started Guide and Paint Shop Pro 7 &amp; Animation Shop 3 Reference book.  The small pamphlet Paint Shop Pro 7 Anniversary Edition Bonus Pack Highlights is an easy way to get familiar with the additional software.<br />* This includes a tutorial program that will teach PSP basics and is always available as reference material.<br />* There are both usable and demo versions of many filters.  The demos will stamp the artwork with the word &quot;Demo,&quot; but the opportunity to discover what Flaming Pear, Eye Candy, and Alien Skin can provide is a treat.<br />The editorial reviews describe the contents, but not the experience.

I have been a user of PC Study Bible since version 2 in 1998. the new interface in v4 alleviates most of the problems from previous versions which showed their DOS/early Windows roots. The incremental releases, up to the current v4.3 have also added some additional functionality that is much appreciated.    In addition, my experience with Biblesoft's customer support has been extremely positive. They are prompt to answer and always answer thoroughly.    What bothers me is that when I bought my original version back in '98 I was pretty green with knowledge of various Bible study tools (commentaries, lexicons, etc). I have since discovered that over half of the resources that Biblesoft included in this \\"Complete Reference Library\\" set are public domain and can be found for free on the web or in other programs. Even the \\"Bonus CD\\" has a large percentage of public domain resources.     I still own PCSB and use it when needed. However, I have discovered e-Sword, a free Bible study program with many free resources available for it, many of which you would have to pay for with PCSB. While perhaps not as flexible, it has suited my studies just fine. Plus, there is a very active online community of e-Sword users (primarily on Yahoo Groups) that have made many other resources available for free as well offering help when needed. There are also some free, third party tools available for creating your own resources in e-Sword, similar to the \\"Authoring System\\" in PCSB.    Biblesoft, like most commercial bible study software publishers, seems to be built on a business model of selling you their base \\"package\\" products and then charging extra for add-ons, which are the things you really want. But it has been my experience that other companies such as Logos and WordSearch include fewer public domain resources in their base package offerings than Biblesoft does. Why pay over $250 for mostly public domain materials?     PCSB is great as a general study tool and the authoring system is nice (though not as good as the one in Bible Explorer.) While PC Study Bible does offer some things that you can't get for free (online or with e-Sword, etc.) there are other commercially available products that I think are better and more powerful, especially if you are planning to get into original language studies. I'd personally recommend the Logos Bible Study Software as a good choice.	2004-08-18

I was wanting to find a software that allowed me to customize the pages the way I wanted and to print them in a certain way. This program definitely DOES NOT offer that. It only allows two ways to print full page or 1/2 page. If you do the 1/2 page it prints the same recipe on each 1/2 which is a waste if you are wanting just to pring one copy. If you select full page it carries over recipes that are longer onto the next page instead of allowing you to print one recipe per page.

Also, WordPerfect can be used both in a professional and personal setting.  Whereas Word is mostly for Business and does not offer the Font choices that WordPerfect does, nor has it ever been as easy to use.  I started out on WordPerfect 1.0 used all versions through X4 and now, X5.  The beauty of WordPerfect is that while the software updates keep it user-competitive with similar word processing products out there, but doesn't make drastic changes in the basic looks.  Unlike others that with each up grade hot buttons are always moved around and settings changed.  (WHO HAS TIME TO TRY AND 'RE-LEARN' a PROGRAM?)  Keep it coming, Corel!

He had no trouble installing it, did mention that the program was \\"scary smart,\\" and now says it makes his job easier and he uses it constantly. For many months I have been toying with the idea of getting one for myself as it is getting difficult for me to type because of pain in my hands; however, I have been using computers for about 20 years now so am very familiar with the ups and downs of software support - who provides it and how good it is.  I always check a product's support pages before purchasing their product(s) - sometimes I DO learn from experience.<br /><br />And that is the one thing that scares me about Nuance.  I have been on their site several times trying to find answers to simple questions like, will it work with Open Office.  No answer on their site, no easy way to contact them.  I have written several emails to what I thought might be the sales office over the last eight months, no replies.  They send me coupons and half-price deals and call me to offer great deals, but no answers to my questions.<br /><br />So, apparently the software works maybe a majority of the time and that is good.  But when something doesn't work AND you can't get any help from the people who made it, what good is it really?  Only good until that first call to support.<br /><br />I'll wait - maybe after the economy sinks for awhile and they find out they actually need customers, they'll decide to do something about their very bad web site and virtually nonexistent customer support.	2008-11-21

In this first episode of the dazzling cinematic fantasy game, you will encounter the superstitious world of Zeleghgorm in the shape of Arrikk Vaheirr. Zelenhgorm - Land of the Blue Moon is the name of a continent on an alien world with wild nature, strange creatures, ancient cities and dark, mystical secrets. As theis epic story begins you, as Arrikk, awaken after having bizarre dreams and discovers that a gigantic ship has run aground in the bat that borders on your garden. From where does this strange ship come from?  To find the clues, you must seel answers from amoung your own people, who wish to have nothing to do with you. When you succeed, a magnificent adventure awaits you - the experience of the mystical continent of Zelenhgorm.    Zelenhgorm, Land of the Blue Moon, is a fantasy continent with earthlike qualities.  Embedded in this civilization are superstition, folk-lore,  magic and science.    You play Arrikk Vaheirr, a young man who lives in the fishing village of Senava. He invents strange machines in his garden. On the day a giant ship runs aground on the river bank near Arrikk's garden, the dormant lighthouse near his house begins to shine again too. Arrikk's quest is to discover the mysteries of the great ship and the truth behind his disturbing dreams.    The game is played in the first person but the scenery is full of activity of all the  characters in the game going about their daily lives. Sometimes you may not be able to talk to an onscreen character but they will still react as Arrikk passes by. The view does switch to the 3rd person view when your character changes his locations or during some very special video sequences.     The cast consists of over 140 live actors. Some of them are known and famous for their parts in  Star Wars movies. Using full-motion video the game has 360 degree panoramic views. All the actions in the game are controlled completely with a mouse, except when using the ESC key to pull up the main menu. Drop down menus will appear when your character is talking to the numerous other characters in the game. You can open and close the bottom screen inventory window by right-clicking and left-clicking, respectively. Objects in your inventory can also be combined and it is necessary for solving some of the game's numerous challenging puzzles.	2005-03-13

It is better than a real aquarium! The movements of the fish are incredibly realistic and some of the background corals are animated as well. The bubble sounds and the ripple pattern of light complete the illusion of \\"real\\".<br /><br /> I have this on both my HP Pavilion Laptop running Windows 7 and my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard. The software loaded easily  and works great on both computers. Both versions allow you to choose which fish and how many of each (up to 30), and to make multiple sets of fish. Only the PC version allows you to cycle the fish sets so that each time your screensaver activates, you can have a different \\"aquarium\\" to view. The PC version also lets you change the lighting effects; however, the Mac version does not have this special feature.  I feel like I have two aquariums in my office!<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this screensaver!	2010-05-30

I have done both upgrade installs and fresh ones.  Both methods worked flawlessly.  I enjoyed using SuperDuper to clone my existing drive to an external then doing a clean install of Leopard and transfering my user info and applications.  (Take notes M$!)  I can say that it performs just as well on all of these machines as long as you have 1 gig or more of RAM.  I had 512 on the G4 and the iMac and I noticed a performance boost once I went to 1+gig of RAM.     I find Leopard to be more stable than Tiger and by that I mean I am seeing WAY fewer spinning beachballs of doom and the few that I have seen have been cleared by a force quit.  I found that force quit was not always successful in Tiger.    I have not yet worked with all of the new features such as Time Machine, but from what I've seen so far in stability improvements, the Family Pack has already paid for itself.

One leaves it at my house much of the time.  Recovering from heart surgery, I find the Wii games have the right amount of activity. Soon, I'll get my own Wii plus this Golf Game.    This is a good game for people from 7 to at least 87. Like all Nintendo Wii games, it gets you off the couch (except for one lazy guy I know). There are 15 realistic depictions of real courses to play. [More course are available after you \\"earn\\" them.]   All aspects of the courses are very well done including placement of trees, bunkers, water and slopes on the fairways and greens. Harbour Town, Pebble Beach and TPC at Sawgrass are very realistic.  It is a great game for anyone who thinks they might want to learn to play golf or for people who play golf and want to compete with pros. You stand sideways to the TV at least 5 feet away, holding the Wii controller like a golf club and make a normal golf swing. There are four types of swings to choose from: \\"Easy\\" allows mostly straight shots. \\"Standard\\" is what is best for most people. You might get a hook or slice if you do it badly but you can quickly learn to make a straight shot of 100 % with distance depending on club selection. \\"Advanced\\" is a bit touchy and tricky. I tried it and went back to Standard.  \\"Numchuck\\" is what my lazy son uses to play it like an arcade game from the couch. You press two buttons to make a swing.  [If my son (age 40) did not work on his feet in a factory all day, I'd urge him more strongly to stand and swing!]    My wife has put up with my interest in golf for years but never came out even to a driving range. She has learned to play this game on Standard Swing and enjoys it. We have had several very good matches. It was fun watching her play our 7-year-old granddaughter who had made her own golf personna - a knockout blonde!     In addition to playing all in my family and several solo games, I have enjoyed playing with several pros who are given good artificial intelligence. I can even make some money in skins games against them. That's how I could afford a $100 glove at the \\"Pro Shop.\\"    There are three bad things about the game, two can be fixed easily if you look carefully at the instructions and options as you start the game. First, there are realistic commentaries by two famous golf announcers that are supposed to be funny but end up being sarcastic and negative. You don't need that when starting out. Fortunately, an option lets you turn those guys off.  The sensitivity of the Wii control field is such that false hits occur once in 8 hits, especially for new players. The most common is a putt stroke that starts when you are swinging the club back! Similarly a standard swing can excute early such as when you reach the max backswing position. These can be fixed by selecting Mulligans ON.    But the one bad thing that cannot be fixed is the fault of the people at EA Sports who programmed in very bad behaviour for many of the non-pro characters (that you make to represent yourself).  These people have no sense of golf etiquette. They have very bad manners. They kick the ball away from the green, stomp on the green in line with a putt, toss themselves down onto the green, sit and sulk and generally behave badly any time something goes wrong. This is hardly the way you want to teach people to behave on a golf course.  I almost did not recommend this game and did remove a star because of this bad behaviour.  But I like the rest of the aspects of the game. Maybe Tiger will start thinking like a Dad now and decide he would not want his daughter learning these bad habits.	2007-07-06

I was initially skeptical, I almost exclusively use Apple Loops and GarageBand. This software is even more simple than those. The best part is...you can check any \\"guess work\\" at the door. This software is so intuitive, it almost writes the songs itself. All you have to have is imagination and a lyric or two. Like millions of others, I have a good ear for music and some talent in writing a lyric (minimal)...but I can't play any instrument to the degree required to produce a worthy track. That is where this product comes into play. With a few clicks of the mouse, I was off writing my first #1 single! Okay, not really, but I did have a great time and rendered some musical tracks that sound strikingly similar to music I hear every day on pop radio. I have used a lot of software over the years to produce at-home recordings (including AcidPro, Band-in-the-Box, etc), but this has been, hands down, the easiest, most user-friendly, highest quality product I've ever tried. The only thing I want next is a version that is compatible with Mac.	2010-08-06

I have been a user of SmartDraw since the VP edition and have watched it evolve up (including the 2012 edition)through the current CI edition.  This is one of the most amazing software products that I have ever used--hands down.  I have been a longtime user of both PowerPoint and Visio, but was looking for something more.  Visio is a great program, but cumbersome at times to use.  I was absolutely mesmerized when I came upon the SmartDraw website and watched the product video which makes a valid case about the powerful impact of visuals in presentations.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  The possibilities are endless!<br /><br />The program in itself is extremely easy to use, allowing one to focus more on the creativity aspect instead of the mechanics.  The layout has the ribbon familiarity of Microsoft programs while still maintaining its own originality.  These software designers are ahead of their time.  The automatic formatting and design templates are unparalleled with anything that I've ever used, and there is no more versatile program out there on the market.  The compatibility of Smart Draw with other familiar programs (e.g. Excel, Word, PDF, etc.) is a huge plus.  I use this program daily in my work, and it consistently puts my finished product above what others in our company can bring to the table.  It is my best-kept \\"secret.\\"  One of the most ingenious features they ever came up with is the VPM (Visual Process Management).  It is what every manager has only dreamed of--a clever way to document every employee's job process so that information is readily available.  I use SmartDraw as much for personal use as I do for business; and my children even use it for school projects on a regular basis.<br /><br />I have to pay a huge compliment here.  Most websites don't impress me, but this one does by leaps and bounds.  The customer support is outstanding.  This is one of the most resourceful sites that I have ever visited!  One actually develops a whole new vocabulary and insight on the perspective of business presentations from the wealth of information that is available.  Each concept is explained thoroughly both in the process as well as business strategy.  I can easily spend an hour every time I access their site, looking through the treasure-trove of examples, suggestions and ideas within the Product, Solutions, Training and Articles tabs.  Perhaps one of the best values of this program is what it gives to the user in a non-physical benefit.  Exposure to this program immediately taps into and unlocks one's imagination and gets the creative juices flowing, bringing out the best in your abilities.  I encourage everyone to make the worthwhile investment for this fantastic program.	2014-08-08

Trend Micro Internet Security Pro (2008 Edition, Including Builds 16.0, 16.05, and 16.1) is dangerous!  Potential Buyers: Beware!<br /><br />I'd been a Norton Internet Security user for years, and while it was slow, I had few problems with it conflicting other software.  When I saw the high ratings for Trend Micro in Consumer Reports, I thought I'd give it a try rather than upgrade to Norton IS 2008.<br /><br />I bought Trend Micro Internet Security Pro from Amazon, and installed it from the CD-ROM the day it arrived.  Instantly, my keyboard stoped functioning, followed by cryptic warnings that the master controller for everything Trend Micro had encountered an error.  I also noted that my Mozy Home Backup quit working too.<br /><br />Shutting off the Trend Micro Transaction Protector seemed to solve the keyboarding problem (that took about 4 reboots to figure out).  The other errors kept coming.<br /><br />Trend Micro got back to me fast, with worthless advice.  First, I was to un-install and then re-install from the original CD-ROM.  That did not work.  Next, I was to un-install and then download and install an \\"updated\\" version (16.0) from a link provided by TM Help.  That did not work.  I replied that the problem was still there, sent screen captures of all the error popups, and the next TM Help person told me I'd have to do it all again!

I needed this version of Windows because the old security camera dvr card software wasn't supposed to work with newer versions, and required 32-bit Windows XP or 32-bit Windows 7. I held off activating this copy until I was sure the cards and DVR software worked with it. When it attempted to activate on its own, it failed and prompted me to call. I cancelled that dialog and later activated it online with no issues.<br /><br />I've since upgraded a copy to Windows 10 32-bit Insider Preview and the DVR software still works. I know it won't install, but it functions fine, and the upgrade to Windows 10 was flawless, even though it's an 'unfinished' preview version (build 10130).<br /><br />So, if you have software and/or hardware that is supported by this version, and are wondering about the free Windows 10 upgrade, it might be worth upgrading after saving the original installation. The particular software I'm using does not work with 64-bit Windows 7, and probably wouldn't with WIndows 10 64-bit. I saved a hard drive image of the Windows 7 installation just to be sure.<br /><br />I can't guarantee that an upgrade to Windows 10 won't break your software, but it's worth a try, particularly since it's a free upgrade. Having said that, this is a very inexpensive way to upgrade a Windows XP computer to Windows 10. I suspect the 32-bit version would be more compatible with older software and hardware.<br /><br />Windows 10 upgrades to the same version of WIndows 7 or 8.x. The Pro version has features that one may or may not use, but my thoughts are it's better to have it and not use it, than to not have it.	2015-06-28

In our recent trip to Portugal, I took my Powerbook, a USB GPS and the Route 66 Europe 2004 software. Portugal seems to be one of the least mapped countries of the EU, but Route 66 did have all the main roads - albeit slightly outdated - in it.    It helped to see our location on the map and even when we weren't able to follow the particular route the software plotted, we could tell we were in the general right direction. The GPS is a must!    But, at least in Portugal, when you stray from the main cities, you are basically on your own. And in the main cities, things have changed so much from the maps in the package (I write this on Summer 2005) that you could easily spend a good chunk of time on a road just to realize you were really driving on a bridge over where you were supposed to be.    So, for Portugal (only place I tested it), useful - yes, very much so. Definitive guide - no.	2005-07-05

Unfortunately, however, the internet is littered with dismayed users who were infected by some form of virus, spyware, scumware, or malware, and all under the not-so-watchful eye of Norton.  With a firewall, antispyware, and antivirus - or as I like to refer the three: hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil - users should be safe.<br /><br />Before I go on, I want to convey that I'm not a typical user.  I've been a programmer, a database administrator, a network administrator, and a member of tech support.  I've worked on top secret systems for the military.  I regularly use acronyms and emoticons.  I've shot-gunned a can of Jolt cola.  I DVR \\"Attack of the Show\\".  I know what I'm doing.  While on a work computer, however, I'm limited to my means, and Norton was purchased as the company software.  How unfortunate.<br /><br />My computer was recently infected clandestinely by the Backdoor.Tidserv!inf Trojan.  First and foremost, Norton didn't stop the intrusion, didn't give a warning, and didn't quarantine the problem.  After I manually ran a full scan (it wasn't recognized during the regularly scheduled scan), however, Norton provided the information that the computer was infected with a high risk, high stealth, high removal, high performance, high privacy Trojan, and the software's action was to \\"review\\".  In other words, Norton's help was, \\"Get rid of it yourself.\\"  What's the point of having Norton?!  What's interesting is that the Norton write-up categorizes this infection as a low risk threat, but the software itself contradicts that concept - inconsistency that jives with the fact that it conflicted with other installed software.<br /><br />After quite a bit of research online, I ended up solving the problem by deleting a temp file, editing a few lines in the registry, booting into safe mode more times that I care to remember, and downloading Malwarebytes Antimalware (MBAM) and Hijackthis - two programs that seem to do what Norton cannot.<br /><br />The tragically hilarious part is that while running MBAM, the scan immediately found the Backdoor.Tidserv!inf Trojan, recognized that it was a rootkit driver (thus requiring more work), and THEN! Norton had a popup notifying me that the Backdoor.Tidserv!inf Trojan was on the computer.  Like a judge needing someone to whisper case law into his ear while deciding a case, I'd much rather prefer knowledge of competency and ability before laying prostrate to the whims of incompetency.ckthis - two programs that seem to do what Norton cannot.

This is the 3rd day and so far, no more sign of any trouble.<br />You must be patient to use this.. it takes several hours for it to finish its cycle of tests and fixes, but compared to taking it in to the shop and not having my computer for several days to two weeks, a pleasure I'll gladly recommend to anyone who has these invasive issues.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the delay in evidence that it actually found something to fix.  There was no report evident to find before it 86'd the spyware, and did not list the culprits.  This may be due to my inexperience in finding it, but there you are.<br />Great product, thank you.	2013-01-23

I'm in charge of our backup system (ArcServe) at work. You'd think I could get this to work if anyone could.     First of all, this won't work from an account that has a space in the name. If so, you will need to enable the administrator account. Second, if you have multiple removable backup drives (so you can take one offsite), the automatic management of space on the backup drive will not work. When the current drive fills up, it will try to remove \\"restore points\\" from the drive that is offsite to get more space. Obviously that doesn't work.     The way it was supposed to work is that it would do a full backup at the beginning of the week and then incrementals the rest of the week. A week's worth of backups constitutes a \\"restore point\\". I'd run it for a couple weeks then swap the offsite disk. It worked for a 3-4 weeks, then it stopped being able to finish the backup by marking it done. There was a remote procedure call error. Part of the software thought the backup was successful, part of it thought it wasn't. So the next day it would try to do a full backup again instead of an incremental. Of course this used up the space on the drive much quicker.     I tried to contact Symantec support. They say there is a support contract number on the box. Be sure to record that somewhere, because they won't talk to you without it, even if you have the license key. You also can't register to open a support case without it. It comes with \\"basic support\\", which means they will only talk to you Monday-Friday 8:00-5:00. If you've bought this for home use be sure to plan to take off a day now and then to get support.    I decided I would try uninstalling the software and reinstall it to see if that would help the problem. Now it won't install because it can't find something. Either it didn't fully uninstall or it deleted something it shouldn't. Symantec's manual uninstall program didn't help.    At this point I'd recommend no one touch thisproduct with a ten foot pole. Home users, especially, should stay away from it.	2011-04-17

I bought it because the obsolete version maps was much cheaper than the current year. The device and software was installed on a netbook and worked great, showing moving map, 3D angle, etc. As other GPS was available to me, I did not use Streets & Trips after the initial testing...but it worked fine and would still be up to date enough for me to use today. I'm giving some thought to installing it on my new laptop. The main reason I didn't use it then, and may not now, is because I know my way around very well without it, and it was intended for my wife. She however, prefered to purchase a small hand held unit to use. I would definitely recommend this product, especially for someone who often sets up new routes for order filling, etc., and needs a larger screen to refer to. There are seat mounts and other type mounts for laptops these days, which would make it convenient to use. Perhaps in the future they might consider making a version which includes device, software and laptop mount.	2013-02-19

Its on sale right here on amazon all the time for just $20. That is just $20 for a whole year to protect your computer. Not bad in my opinion.

I would skip the Mac version and instead go with a Windows version.  This isn't hard to do these days with Windows systems or an emulator easily being affordable.  This Mac version simply is not at the same level.  It's at least several generations behind the cheapest Windows version, and debatable perhaps being a decade or more behind in features overall. The other issue is that if you're not already familiar with QB's and want training, all the training will be for Windows versions.  You'll get funny puzzled looks if you even mention a Mac version to a QB trainer.<br /><br />In this 2012 version, they only improved very little over the 2011 version (see my old review) and frankly I'm surprised the 2012 version wasn't just released for free for 2011 owners (it isn't) since it's such a small 'enhancement'.	2011-12-28

Manga Studio Debut 4 is full of ways to make professional comics just like the box says.     BUT! you would think that software with a simple premise like this would be a little more user friendly and streamlined. Having to make new \\"layer types\\" for sketches and panels is a little daunting, in my opinion. I guess I was hoping for \\"Comic Life\\" with drawing tools and panel cutters, and simple layers. Again this is a good product, just research the interface thoroughly before you buy it. If you like your software simple and straight forward this is not it. If you don't mind learning to be real technical and artistic at the same time, then you might like it.	2009-09-28

I bought Drive Scrubber to clean 2 pcs so I could donate them to charity.<br />Iolo's product did the job on my laptop, although it took some figuring out as to which options did exactly what. Unfortunately the option I would've liked to have had, to wipe out everything except the operating system, wasn't available so I had to do the wipe piecemeal.<br />Where I really ran into trouble though was with my desktop. My DVD drives weren't working so I downloaded the software from the Internet. This was fairly easy. When I tried to wipe my drives though, I got an error message which said the wipe had been \\"canceled.\\" Several tries later, and Drive Scrubber still wouldn't work properly, so I tried tech support. It was Saturday however and there's no tech support on the weekends. I did send an email describing my problem.<br />Monday I called Iolo and a very curteous support agent said I had to take a System Snapshot of my computer and email them the results. I did this and was told my report would be escalated and someone would contact me in 24-48 hours, but \\"probably sooner.\\"<br />Two days later no one had contacted me so I called again and got a similar curteous runaround.<br />55-hours later and I still haven't gotten a call or an email to fix my problem. So my recommnendation is this: only buy this product if you expect things to go smoothly, because if things don't you may be out of luck.	2012-04-11

I've been using Adobe Acrobat since version 4. Version 5 was a very useful upgrade, worth every cent. Version 6 was a grand waste of money and has turned into a waste of time. Files take longer to save in Adobe Acrobat 6, but they do end up being smaller, so maybe there is a more advanced compression algorithm at work. Nevertheless, files do take about twice as long to save in the new version.<br /><br />Furthermore, at least for my line of work, I see no useful additions to the software. The interface looks a little fancier, and a little more advanced with more curved lines and a splash screen with transparency...(everybody together now, &quot;Oooooh, aaaaaaah&quot;). But, at least for my line of work, I have not seen any productivity or security upgrades which make the investment worthwhile. Save yourself the money and stay with version 5.0.<br />Unfortunately, it seems that the other reviewers' negative comments are right on the money.	2004-05-10

Make sure you are an experienced computer user if you are going to pick and choose.<br /><br />I was able to move complicated licensed software such as the Adobe Creative Suite 2 Premium, Macromedia Studio MX etc. Even my roboform came over with all the pertinent data.<br /><br />Be logical when you choose. Don't transfer many explorer extenders, such as google toolbar or desktop search. They are quite easy to redownload.<br /><br />Let me put this as simply as possible. If you are an experienced or expert computer user, and you want to move particular software, settings, and files from your old computer to your new computer, this is the software that will do it for you. I have no doubt that 90% of the trouble people have is trying to move things that they ought not move.<br /><br />If you want to move software suites without reinstalling them, software you've had so long you lost the disk etc. then Ultra Control isn't just AN answer, it's the ONLY answer. (And if you buy it at the alohabob website, it's downloadable and you don't have to pay until AFTER the transfer!)<br /><br />This is the one you have been looking for.	2005-08-25

The synch function doesn´t delete files on the target computer that were deleted on the source computer (curiously, PCSync, a product from the same company does this function correctly).

The paper clip icon in the Microsoft Office programs is not adequately performing the duties that Microsoft has bestowed upon it. I feel that the paper clip has simply grown obnoxious, and most users - myself included - feel no deep personal connection to this figure. However, the gravity of this problem is nothing in comparison to the horrifying lack of any sort of a ninja icon in Microsoft Word. If Microsoft were to switch to a ninja icon instead of that foolish paper clip, not only would consumers be more excited about using Microsoft Office, we would also be more willing to take advice on grammar, formal writing, and spelling from this lovable, wise, rambunctious, well-endowed, and family-friendly character.  Instead, we are reduced to taking grammar suggestions from a bouncy, awkwardly cheerful piece of aluminum. What a disgrace.	2009-10-08

I would suggest the beginner use a simple, structured exercise book in conjunction with this, as this program isn't structured at all.  The intermediate or advanced speaker can dive right in, although I'd suggest getting some of the add-ons, as well.  I haven't seen them on Amazon yet, but you can get them from this company directly.  You can go through great works of literature or television segments or travelogues to build comprehension, vocabulary, etc.  I'd also recommend this company's WordAce, which is a talking dictionary, but also contains grammar and synonym quizzes.  Great fun.  There are a couple of minor glitches to be ironed out still.  Occasionally the software seems to get stuck on a word and you'll have to cancel out of a quiz and restart, but overall, I couldn't be happier with the software.	2003-03-19

So to start, the sounds in this library are fantastic! I have had a few ideas for some tracks that were calling for Latin percussion. Since purchasing the gear I would need was out of the question, I opted to search for a sound library instead. After a ton of research I had already settled on Superior Drummer 2.0, so I decided to look at this EZX pack.<br /><br />It definitely does not disappoint, as a matter of fact I was quite blown away by how good everything sounds. The main instruments I was after you Conga's, Bongo's, Timbales, and Shakers; this has that and many more. This pack works with and requires EZDrummer or Superior Drummer 2.0; SP2.0 maintains backwards compatibility with all existing EZX packs, and adds the higher quality SDX packs.<br /><br />I know I am not very good at using my MIDI keyboard to do drum parts, so I use my Alesis DM10 Studio eKit and simply assign the pieces I want to the various triggers, and record them that way. Usually I'll go back and add in single cymbal or shakers with the keyboard. I do not know if there's a way to automatically map the pieces to an eKit, I honestly have not looked; SP2.0 makes it very easy to simply assign them using it's \\"Learn\\" key under the MIDI Mapping.<br /><br />So to buy this just remember you must have EZDrummer or SP2.0 as well, this is an \\"add-on pack\\" to those, not a stand alone product. With that said, I was very happy with my purchase, everything was received a day or two earlier than expected, the sounds are fantastic, I will absolutely be purchasing more Toontrack products in the future. If you need a good set of Latin percussive sounds and you don't have the time/money/gear/room to record your own, take a serious look at this pack. On Toontrack's site they have some great examples as well as on YouTube. Hope it helps...	2012-04-03

Well, for $100, I expected much much more. It's probably OK if you want the most basic simplistic approximation of a space, but you cannot:<BR>1. Customize any objects. Got a curved counter or shelf? Forget it! The so-called CAD tools are for floor plans only, you cannot create your own 3D objects.<BR>2. Import any pictures or textures. Want to put in your carpet or wood grain or marble or stucco, or art or whatever? Forget it!<BR>3. Import any 3D objects. Would aleviate a lot of problems. Other programs allow it. Forget it!<BR>4. Adjust texture directions. Put wood grain on a molding. Note the direction of the grain. Want to rotate it 90 degrees, so it looks right? Forget it!<BR>5. Export to ANY 3D format. Want to share the design via VRML or 3DS or ANYTHING? Forget it! It does export DXF, but only the flat floor plan.<BR>So again, if you don't mind the barest basics, this is an easy and fun program. But if you want to get an idea of what your place would look like if you actually put in the stuff you wanted, there ain't no way, unless you happen to use the boring objects they ship with.	2004-03-17

You can edit a movie in minutes, but you can't output a sharp video with it. No matter how hard you try, all renders will be blurred. Any NTSC format including mpg-1, mpg-2, mpg-4,  and wmv are blurred, no matter what the input media is. Pinnacle even supplies you with a sample movie that's sharp and clear, but you cannot render it to any format and retain the original quality. This makes this product one to stay away from.<br /><br />The editing isn't really all that simple either. You can't set markers and regions. The undo function undoes things like stretching the timeline. You can't name your project and tell it what to save your output media format or the filename. Many things become repetitive. It's not that easy of an interface.<br /><br />Don't buy this! Spend a little more time with your video by learning to use Sony's Vegas 8. You'll save yourself a lot of grief. At least you'll get videos that are rendered as sharp as your original, whether they're imported from a file or from your camcorder.	2007-10-19

If you own a Mac and use OX-X Tiger or later, this is NOT the device for you. It may be fine for a Windows/PC user. ColorVision phased the Plus edition out toward the end of 2004. Their support for it is quite limited here in the middle of 2006. Mac users with OS-X Tiger or later OSs will discover that synching a printer profile with their monitors cannot be done with the included software. There is also an annoyance in performing this synching even if you use a Widows-PC. In order to synch your monitor with your printer, you must scan in a color chart. Should you lack a scanner, or not have one available, again, you will not be able to create a printer profile and hence synch your monitor with you printer - which is the sufficient purpose of this device.  <br /> <br />You will, however, be able to re-profile your monitor such that it will show colors consistent with some objective standard. This may come much closer to your printer/paper profile than the image presently displayed on your monitor. This device may be very useful to owners of older Mac OS operating systems (although while it is consistent with OS-X,  I do not know how old or whether this software was created pre-Panther OS) and Windows PC users - should they have scanners on line. Apparently that's who the designers of this device had in mind. I have returned my Spyder2Plus in exchange for a Spyder2Pro, ColorVision's currently supported product, which I hope will allow me to competently profile both my monitor AND my printer. I look forward to favorably reviewing that purchase in the near future.	2006-08-15

These 4 CDs, featuring the renaissance, romanticism, the pre-modern era, and the 20th century, were part of the 10 CDs of History Through Art, starting with Ancient Greece, copyrighted by Zane Publishing Co. 1994-96.  At that time they were considered highly valuable tools, essential for any school libraries. Now they are somewhat dated in the technology and design. The pictures are of slightly poorer quality, but quite acceptable. Besides numerous slides of paintings, sculptures, architecture and photos, there are brief narrations and text encyclopedias.  You get a lot of interesting information, especially the historical background. There is lovely background music that matches each period of art. These 4 CDs are still very worthwhile for information and enjoyment. The price is reasonable.  (They cost twice as much if you buy them separately from Fogware Publishing.)  Please note the following in small print on each CD. &quot;Product not licensed for use in schools, colleges, or public libraries.&quot; The copyright date is 2000, which is misleading.	2001-03-30

For people who want to command the program, it merely tells them what they already know.    Norton's UI is made up of a series of windows and icons that attempt to reach the computer illiterate. They can be turned off, but they give computer-smart users little peace of mind.    For example, the Phishing filter on internet explorer. It sits there, telling you it is \\"on\\". So what? I have NEVER seen it do ANYTHING in my entire online experience.    It didn't even warn me when I went to a fake site, firefox let me know and I got nothing from Norton.     Along with this, Norton is highly lacking in features. Unlike McAffe, it doesn't have the very handy SiteAdvisor, which, through the equivilent of Website crash-testing, rigourously checks every icon and file on any given site and gives a rating of how safe that website is.     I can only reccomend this program to those who don't know how to protect themselves and those who just go to a few sites over and over again. Quite like acting as though you had a limited account on Windows.    For those who want to explore without worry, look elsewhere.	2009-02-01

I ordered this software to specifically use in my home theater setup that includes a 65\\" Panasonic Plasma, Denon AV receiver, a WDTV Live Hub, PS3, and a networked PC running a raid array containing my DVD/video library, music, pictures and the like. This is my first interaction with PowerDVD since the early 2000's when it came pre-loaded on my Compaq desktop. Clearly Cyberlink's intention is to make PowerDVD the centerpiece of your home theater experience. This software is complete overkill if you're just looking to playback Blu-ray's, DVD's and do some streaming on a laptop and is really geared toward the serious home theater owner.<br /><br />--------------------<br />SETUP:<br /><br />Installing the software on my Windows 7 desktop is about as easy as it gets and is standard fare. Pop in the disc, follow the on-screen guide and finally use the included product code to register the software with Cyberlink. To their credit Cyberlink actually included a full manual in the box with their software which is something that is becoming increasingly rare with software. This makes looking up features, answering the, \\"what does this button do?\\" questions very easy. After setup and launching the software it performed a quick scan of my hard drives and indexed my media files as well as presenting a number of video tutorials about the software.<br /><br />--------------------<br />FEATURES:<br /><br />Oh boy, there's a lot to cover here!<br /><br />First, I suppose is the myriad of supported movie formats including: BD-R (various specs), BDROM Profile 2.0 (BD-Live), BDROM Profile 5.0 (BD-3D), AVCREC, AVCHD, DVD-Video, DVD-VR, DVD+VR, VCPS, VCD, SVCD, CD. There are even more supported video formats (I'll list some of the more popular one's only): AVC, AVI, DIVX, H264, MKV, MOV, MP4, MP4V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, TIVO, WM, WMV. Music formats include: AAC, AC3, ADTS, APE, AOB, DTS, FLAC, M4A, MID, MKA, MP2, MP3, MPA, OGG, RMI, WAV, WMA<br /><br />For a full listing of supported formats (movies, video, music & pictures): [...]<br /><br />TrueTheater HD:<br />Cyberlink touts this as their DVD upscaling and Blu-ray enhancing software. I've used various upscaling DVD players over the years and the effect here is similar. Don't expect Blu-ray quality out of TrueTheater and honestly I'm okay with regular DVD 480p quality for my older movies.<br /><br />TrueTheater:<br />PowerDVD features a variety of other enhancement features like TrueTheater Motion that tries to smooth video by enhancing the frame rate. TrueTheater Stretch that stretches a 4:3 frame to 16:9. TrueTheater Denoise & Stabilizer that are geared toward home movie takers. In short a lot of features that you may never use unless you are really, really into tinkering with video quality and getting the absolute most out of your videos and movies.<br /><br />For my uses I focused more on the ability to playback Blu-ray discs, video files on an internal raid and external NAS. With these functions PowerDVD performs fantastically.<br /><br />--------------------<br />POTENTIAL BLOAT:<br /><br />There is a lot to this software. So much \\"extra\\" stuff that I'm tempted to call it bloat. YouTube, Flickr and the now standard Facebook plug-in are alive and present here. I have no interest in connecting to Facebook on my home theater as I already have a myriad of devices that do the job better. The YouTube integration is admirable but still works better from a browser. Flickr is the interesting feature in the chance that you store a lot of photos on that site and like to view them on your PC/home theater.<br /><br />I also did not utilize the 3D or the 3D conversion of 2D content features as it's not something that's appealing to me. Similarly I did not try out the 4K features as I don't have compatible content.<br /><br />Cyberlink also offers apps for Android & iTunes compatible devices that allow you to stream content and have basic remote control functions. Again a feature that I didn't use because of redundancy with apps/programs that are already in place in my home.<br /><br />--------------------<br />Closing:<br /><br />PowerDVD is really geared toward someone looking for an all-in-one solution and doesn't want to bounce around from different media players for different content. For folks who already have established processes and software that you use and are familiar with PowerDVD will offer less value and thus be a harder buy at its premium price.am content and have basic remote control functions.

Really too soon to tell, but judging from the trouble installing, I have to say it's 'still Microsoft.'  (About fifteen attempts before either of my DVD drives recognized either the 32 bit or the 64 bit discs.)  Now installed, it looks good, but...  An IE11 screen message insists on wanting to trouble shoot every time a new animated add changes.  And, there is the annoyance of the learning curve when all I want to do is get my work done.  About a month now - seriously considering accepting the loss and installing Windows 7.  Windows 8.1 is absolutely marketing genius for Microsoft - there is no question why Gates entrusted his enterprise to 'the new guy':  All 'tiles' funnel the user to Microsoft.  Using the Desktop is inadequate for my use of this PC.  Right now I'm thinking two stars are generous.  It's been a few months now.  I like it less.  It seems to me, that Gates' original vision was 'a world wide common language.'  So why am I spending so much time relearning Windows?  I have been a 'fluid' Windows user since 95.  I don't mind being a 'newbie' with a new interest, but not with a tool I've been using for decades.  I just want to get my work done.  I most definitely do not recommend this operating system.  I did try a Demo of Window 7, but right now I'm thinking Mac.	2015-04-01

I find the user interface to be intuitive and the potential results to be pretty cool stuff from semi-skilled or even amateur hands.  I had had tremendous problems installing prior versions of Studio, but 18 worked easily on the first try for me (on a machine that had had prior versions of Studio installed on it, for what it’s worth – your mileage may vary).<br />My only problem with this Plus edition is that it doesn’t pack much more in the features department than the basic yet also lacks the “cool” editing effects that come packaged in the ultimate edition.  You also can’t author to blu-ray yet can work with 3D video with the Plus edition, which seems backwards.  I would expect that many more people would rather just create basic blu-rays than mess around with anything 3D.<br />One nice feature with the Plus is the ability to capture video and audio right from the screen and then edit it.  This is invaluable when creating computer training/demo videos or capturing a live presentation complete with its slides.	2015-05-27

It brought me into the digital media world and I've been archiving and organizing my media.  My dad had a bunch of old home movies on vhs.  I decided to get Ultimate 2009 with a video converter.  The converter is very small, like a thumbdrive.  Before I started I used the new roxio utility to backup the hard drive.  I know there are a lot of programs that do this but since it's included I won't slack off about backing up.      Starting the conversion wasn't very hard.  Whatevers playing on the vcr shows in the roxio creator window.  After I found this out I freed the vcr from the tv and moved it closer to the desktop. It captured video in 720 x 480 resolution.  My next step was editing down the video.  The video programs are so much better than the one in 8.  I think it is worth getting the hang of videowave even if its more difficult than cinemagic.  It does a lot more and I had tighter control over the cuts.      Next step was making a dvd.  Old tapes didn't have HD quality so I didn't use that feature.  I made a virtual disk first so I could make another copy easilly.  I chose the dvd-vcr format to make it work in the dvd player.  The dvd menu selection is also much better.  Even my dad was able to use it like a store bought movie dvd.  The virtual disk made the extra copy creation fast.      Just using a few features I can see that there are many improvements from version 8. I didn't use any versions in between so I can't say anything about them.  I'm happy that I could make an archive of the videos so easily.	2008-09-21

Not only can this be found at reduced cost elsewhere, the content of this release is worth zilch.  At the very least I would recommend [[ASIN:B000P4Q8BG PC Study Bible Version 5 Reference Library Plus]].  The BibleSoft website has good literature comparing the differences between libraries.  As a PC Study Bible users since version 3.0 I currently consider this software to be ABANDONWARE.  While they continue to add books for sale to the library, I would not recommend this product until a new development is forthcomming.  Though I do not use it, the BibleSoft user community currently recommends Logos (most major operating systems / devices supported, follow [[ASIN:B0062RM1VQ Logos Bible Software]])  Update Feb 15, 2016: As to that abandonware thing.  The more development has been continuing for some time in the background.  Biblesoft has now released an app version, a MAC version, and a touch compatible version.  I won't be testing MAC, but will be testing the app and windows 10 in the near future.

I have been a fan of Franklin Covey planners & software for years, dating back to my Handspring Visor so long ago.   You can imagine my disappointment when I purchased this software to use with my brand new Palm Z22 and cannot get it to work.  So far, I have installed and uninstalled various conduits, rebooted my PC countless times, hard reset my Palm (losing all of my stored information in the process - most inconvenient) and still nothing.  Apparently the issue is with 'Agilix GoBinder' which is the little engine that supposedly makes the sync happen.  I have also attempted to contact Agilix customer support who were very helpful, but unable to solve the problem.  FC support is useless.      It is very frustrating to pay so much $$ for what one would think is software from a reliable name, only to have so many complications.    To say the least, I am dissapointed in a company which I thought would have more care to put out products that would be of use to their loyal customers.  Since 'open' software cannot be returned for a refund I guess I will have to use the CD as a coaster and begin shopping for a suitable alternative!	2007-02-14

There's no need to have this much \\"security\\" on your PC, taking up resources, slowing down productivity, and making everything a chore.  As a matter of fact, for absolutely no cost, all you need are a good active antivirus/antispyware program (Microsoft Security Essentials), a good secondary/passive malware detection & removal program (MBAM), and a good web browser (Firefox).  As for the other features of this bloated software package, similar and better tools are available for free: you have a firewall built into your router, and another one is available on your PC; good email programs (Gmail) will block spam & warn about potential phishing; automatic back-ups, file sharing, parental controls, registry cleaners, file encryption, secure deletion, etc., etc., are ALL available for free, if you want them, and if you don't, why pay for them & have them use up valuable system resources?	2010-04-29

I would like to confirm that i officially upgraded to vegas pro 11 from Vegas Movie HD 11 using Amazon's upgrade path!  Yes, that's right!  I upgraded to PRO from a $40 software!  A Pro quality editing application for under $300!  You can't beat that!  If you still not sure if your current sony editor will upgrade to pro, then head over to sony creative online store website, and click on the \\"Purchase\\" tab, \\"Upgrades\\".  Select \\"Upgrade to Vegas Pro 11 from Vegas Movie Studio\\".  Add one of those options to your cart. Another prompt will pop-up asking you to enter Qualifyin license key.  Enter your key in the popup window.  If it goes through to confirm your purchase, then you will know it will upgrade or not.  Even if it doesn't, then buy the lowest end movie studio like i did and and just upgrade it to pro through amazon.<br /><br />I purchased my Vegas Movie HD 11 downloadable version from Sony's Online store.  An email was sent out to me containing my serial number.  It use it to verify the upgrade was available to me. Once the download completed, I installed and registered it. Pro will register itself upon installation with all your previously registered info.  This was really a hassle free experience.<br /><br />I chosen Vegas over the other guys for a few reasons,  First because it is the only \\"PRO\\" quality editing app that supports ATI GPU cards. I was able to render 1080p videos in minutes. 2nd was their rendering quality is about as good as it a gets. If you ever wonder how people's youtube/vimeo videos look so good, is because of pro editing software like this.  You just can't get that quality from the low end editing apps.  Sure there are a few free apps that will do a great job, but that requires you use multiple applications and a ton of research.  3rd was because from some odd reason i kept going back to vegas.  I think i found it easier to work with then adobe and avid.<br /><br />There you have it...  Now buy it..!	2011-12-03

Content manager, no, no, no	Absent a much higher end and usually much more expensive tool, CyberLynk's PhotoDirector 5 does the job as an editor but it's not even remotely as easy or quick as it claims to be. I won't be using it as a content manager.<br /><br />Yes, you can manage photos but it's not 'effortlessly'. My main problem with most tools that offer to do content 'management' on my behalf is that they claim to know the 'right way' which is usually their own rigid way of imposing 'order' into my private universe and it tends to clash with 'my way'. A tool unable to compromise if not let me keep 'my way' of organizing things becomes an annoyance and the opposite of 'useful' because all it does is slow me down. PhotoDirector's content management model clashes with mine and reconciliation may not be possible or it didn't happen after a few weeks of use. Its insistence of swallowing all my photos into what it calls 'projects' and 'albums' might make sense if you get PhotoDirector the day you start taking digital shots but it's a pain if you already have 5000 or 10,000 photos around, already organized by some other criteria. I expected more flexibility.<br /><br />Yes, photo processing can be fast but, as always, there is a correlation between speed and quality and touching the program-provided magic wands that should do auto adjustments for the better don't always produce a better photo. In fact, the better your original shot was, the higher the odds are that you get something worse if you try to process it with the auto options. Yes, creative photo editing is possible but you don't get half the tools that, let's say, Photoshop would give you. And there's, of course, the learning curve whenever dealing with an unfamiliar user interface but that can be overcome in time. PhotoDirector is quite Okay as an editing tool, it really is and it's possible to get better and better results as you become more familiar with the tools.<br /><br />Sadly, the photo editor is tightly integrated with the 'manager' part meaning that if you have no use for the manager, the only way to 'liberate' your contents from PhotoDirector's rigid structure is to grab your work as soon as it's done and move it someplace where your photos are organized the way you want them organized.<br /><br />Overall, the package is a pretty nice but not 'pro' quality photo editing tool that's too tightly integrated into a photo management scheme I won't accept.

Yesterday I reduced my rating to 3 stars, because it requires Adobe Flash Player, which still won't work on my android phone, but again works on the desktop computer.  Flash Player is known to have security problems, and is being disabled in some platforms.  To get it working. again, I had to uninstall Google Chrome, install Adobe Flash Player from Internet Explorer, then re-install Google Chrome.  Chrome has its own version of Flash Player, which is not compatible with this Service Manual disk, but which prevented the installation of the Internet Explorer version that does work with this disk.  I recommend disabling Flash Player in Internet Explorer, because of the security risks with that version.  My original evaluation follows:  Excellent buy.  At first I thought maybe the 2014 manual wasn't up-to-date, because it showed all clutch plates as being the same part number, but when you buy them, two plates are different.  However when I went in to look at the dealer's manual, it also showed all plates the same, but their PARTS LIST shows them as different, so this is a Yamaha problem  The data is in a flash-player format, so it took some work to get my smartphone to read it, but now it can (just copy the larger page files to your SD card, and find an app that can read it, and make your own index) [Edit:  this method no longer works, but there is an on-line site that can convert several pages of Flash Player files into pdf files, which do work]	2014-11-04

Yes, there is resource/economic management. This isn't all about warfare, in fact, you should be focusing MORE on your economy than your military in my opinion.<br /><br />2. Loading times are long (even for mid-level pc specs), but they were long for every single total war game prior to that. So yes, if this is your first TW game, you'd be perplexed. But for TW vets, it's normal for us.<br /><br />3. The AI is average depending on your difficulty level. Of course the AI will be pathetic on easy. I play on hard where every battle is winnable.<br /><br />4. This game runs smoothly on any computer built a few years ago. If you're playing on high settings on an entry level pc, of course there will be slow down. Try playing around with the settings to see how far you can max out the settings.<br /><br />So with that out of the way, I played Shogun Total War, Rome Total War, Empire Total War, and currently playing Shogun 2. I completed one long campaign on hard and haven't touch the multiplayer (because I was never great wit RTS games online) so I'll focus mainly on the single player portion. If you're a total war fan, I don't have to tell you how this game is set up. It's like any previous total war game, but is less complex than Empire (which isn't a bad thing) and more indepth than Rome (which is a good thing I'd say). I would argue that this game is very similar to the original Shogun. Which also means you'll be limited to only fighting in Japan (having China, Mongol, and Korea factions would be nice) and you'll be fighting with only a limited choice of units (sword, spear, arrow). There are special units like ninja, heros, and monks, but they won't be the bulk of your army.<br /><br />But even with those limitations, I keep coming back because there are so many different paths to beat the game: you can turn allies against each other, back stab your closest ally, bribe your way to defeating armies, or even start religious revolts. As of this writing, I logged in 100+ hours of gameplay and I would recommend the Sengoku Jidai, Saints and Heroes, and Otomo DLC. These are my favorite DLC and they add much more replay value to the game by adding much needed new units.<br /><br />I didn't get the game when it first released (I purchased this a few months ago) so I didn't run into any bugs after Steam updated the game to it's latest patch.

Also you can see hear the teacher playing the piano and singing the song, and as the songs have the lyrics on them, you can practice singing along as well.

Then, somewhere around version 6 or 7, it began going downhill fast, losing functionality and becoming bloated with ditzy &#34;design&#34; portfolios and superficial options, whereas the basic software capability became much more glitchy, as well as annoying due to reverting to contrived, default conditions that assume a particular application like flow charts.  Only clowns who have never had to make anything physically work would have ever made such changes.  Also, they made it so you can't use your old versions with the files if they are even opened with the newer versions.  It's as though Smartdraw was taken over by a band of cheesy marketers who think &#34;design&#34; only means making graphics for power-point slide presentations, and, so, now it's just pathetic.

It appears some data corruption was the cause. So I spent hours moving my data over manually. What a nightmare.<br />Once I finally got to use Quicken 2003, I was disappointed in the upgrade. Personally, I didn't see much difference from my 2002 version. I had really hoped that the new version would be a big leap in usability, as the promo material promised. But Quicken 2003 still suffers from an incredibly hard to learn and understand interface. I'm really good with computers, but getting all my accounts to balance out just seems impossible -- and I've spent days determined to figure it out.<br />Then the fun began. First, I attempted to transfer my Quicken data into Turbotax to make my taxes quick and easy. BIG MISTAKE. For whatever reason, Quicken doesn't transfer all the data you need to Turbotax. If you read the fine print buried in the help manual, it warns you about this. So when you go to do your taxes, it's almost impossible to know which data transfers and which doesn't. So you end up either entering data twice or not at all -- my taxes were off by over $800 using the automatic data transfer!! Eventually, I just gave up and entered all my data into TurboTax manually. So what started out as an effort to save time quickly became a huge WASTE of time.<br />Then Quicken just stopped printing on me. I had to uninstall and reinstall the program several times to get it working again. I would have called technical support, but they CHARGE for technical support, even if the problem is a bug in their own program. I tried the online chat, but that's was just awful. Halfway through, the tech support guy told me that I had to close Quicken... which in turn closes the chat window! So I had to start all over again. Nightmare!<br />In the end, all these issues add up and make me believe that this program is not worth the money in any way, shape or form.I'd save a lot more time just using an Excel spreadsheet.	2003-03-26

Since I had studied Spanish years ago, I thought this package might help me restore my former skill with the vocabulary, which always seemed to be my weak point. Admittedly, I failed to remember that since this is a CD-ROM, it runs from the DVD, and I wasn't expecting the program to run as slowly as it did. But my bigger problem was the interface, the lack of instructions (even rudimentary ones), and the blurred accents of the native voices that I was supposed to mimic.<br /><br />It's possible that this product might be appealing to small children, since it uses cartoonish characters. For me, after several hours of frustration, I decided I would have to try another approach.	2010-06-16

When I mixed down a live recording in Soundbooth I was unable to get my software to burn a CD.  Even though my files were in .wav format my burner told me I needed to have the files in .wav format.  I had a copy of Mixcraft 4 and was able to bring the files into Mixcraft and burn the CD easily.  I began looking at recording software and editing software to do some studio work.  I evaluated ACID, Studio One and Music Creator through their trial software.  I also tried Mixcraft 5.  Cubase does not have a trial version so I was not able to evaluate it but I have used Cubase 4 LT which came with my PreSonus Firebox.  I found it more difficult but didn't get much chance to try it out because I lost my license when my hard drive crashed.  It has an easy GUI interface and produces .wav files which are compatible with other software.  With Mixcraft 5 they have added video.  After using the trial, I ordered the software.  This one is worth the price.	2011-10-03

Dutch Now has significantly improved my students pronunciation and listening skills through the audio features (such as Full Native Speaker Pronunciation). It has expanded their vocabularies through games like Vocabulous and just in general has helped to improve their language skills. Dutch Now has many features that provide for great practice and review. I would highly recomend this program if you wanted to learn or needed help learning Dutch.	2003-05-30

The primary programs in the suite are CorelDraw for page layout and vector based drawing, and Photo Paint for digital image editing and retouching. In addition to these two main programs, the Graphics Suite also includes CorelCapture, Duplexing Wizard, Bitstream Font Navigator, and an Extras folder with clip art, digital images and fonts.<br /><br />The installation disk drop downs allow you to install as much or as little of the suite as you need or want. One section is for the programs that comprise the suite itself, a separate section is for the extras - clip art, photos, fonts, etc. (Even the fonts are available with a drop down that lets you deselect some that you might not use.)<br /><br />Corel has provided a generous amount of documentation, reference material and instruction to make it easier to learn and use these programs including a 300+ page manual and plenty of tutorials.<br /><br />Recommended!	2013-04-11

Unfortunatly most of them are poorly composed so they're really boring. Because of this I would not recommend this package for professional designers. Also, despite the ability to export images in many different formats and resolutions, none of them are suitable for print. Even at the highest resolutions, images will be pixilated when printed. One positive for this product is the search engine and image viewer. When entering a search word, it updates the appropriate matches as you go. This saves time and makes it very easy to see what's available. Here's the bottom line, get this product if your interested in web design or you just want images for comping. Otherwise, look elsewhere.	2002-06-20

Why doesn't it just have all of the features and functionality of QB Pro for PC???  It's just that simple...let me sort in the reconciliation window by column, let me find an item on the chart of accounts by typing in an account number, sub account number, or part of an account title or sub account title.  Just the simple things would be a great start, and some of these were available in QB for MAC 2007!  Why aren't they in this version?     Also, the multiuser version is horrendous.  Very little real network-level configuration going on there...it just really doesn't work well at all.  After purchase we installed, then uninstalled, and are back to copying files, including spending significant time with Intuit support and our MAC and QB knowledgeable techs.      Frankly, at this rate, why bother with a MAC version at all and just let us MAC folks have a PC in the corner to run QB.  It' be just that much simpler on us all, and not provide daily frustration with very simple functions being MIA.     Thanks.	2011-08-02

And then, realize a person needs an inborn drive to tackle the learning curve, they'll simply display the product box on the computer desk shelf, so others will say, &#34;Hey!

(I impatiently waited 25 years for a terrific version of FTM to be produced -- I don't do Windows.) It took iPhone and iPad to convince FTM-company/Ancestry to FINALLY devote resources to make the Mac version on par with the Windows version. I didn't rate it five stars because the software does not have Drag-and-Drop. Drag-and-Drop has been around for decades -- why not?<br /><br />I bought the \\"The Companion Guide to Family Tree Maker for Mac 2\\" separately from FamilyTreeMaker.com for $14, which I rate only two stars (**).

It's not particularly informative -- one thing is that it does not go into enough detail on stuff. The index sucks. If this book comes free, fine.

Big mistake.  The new version is bloated, buggy, and obnoxious.    First, installation is very slow.  Make sure you have a few hours free. 5-10 minutes of unpacking, 3-4 minutes of Nero's installer, and then 5 minutes or so of the Windows installer.  After all those steps, it checks for any problems, like the presence of a previous version of Nero.  If there's a previous version, it asks if it can uninstall it; you can only have one version at a time, and there's no going back.  After the uninstall, it demands that the computer be rebooted.  Then you get to do the install all over again.      Then, after the installation, if you want to burn CDs or DVDs from a non-administrator account, you have to enable Nero Burn Rights.  Then you get to reboot again.    During installation, Nero tries to install some toolbar from Ask.  (You know, Barry Diller's company, IAC, the one that's being broken up.) There's a checkbox to turn this off.  Make sure you disable that.    Then Nero tries to become the default program for just about every audio and video filename extension known.  Just turn all of those off.  Also turn off all the Nero stuff it wants to put in your toolbar.    Oh, and it tries to get you to sign up for Nero spam.    OK, now we're through installation.  But we're not done yet.  Nero will have installed several permanently running processes, none of which you want.  There's \\"NMIndexStoreSvr.exe\\", \\"NMIndexingService.exe\\", \\"NBService.exe\\", and \\"IoctlSvc.exe\\".  These have to be dealt with.    \\"The \\"NM*\\" processes are part of something called \\"Nero Scout\\", which is an indexing application you don't want.  Under Program Files -> Nero -> Tools -> Nero Scout, there's a dialog box with a checkbox to disable Nero Scout.  Use that.  The useless processes will still be launched at startup, but will stop using time and disk accesses.    Actually removing the launch of those useless processes takes more work, but removal tools exist.OK, with this turkey installed, we try to make a DVD.  The application for this is called \\"Nero Vision\\".  This is like a weak version of DVDit coupled to a weak version of Adobe Premiere.  It's buggy; it generates DVD menus semi-automatically, but when I deleted a clip and added a new one, the menus got out of sync with the clips.  And, in fact, so far every video DVD I've made will not play in a regular DVD player, although  it will play on a PC.     This product has negative value. DO NOT BUY.	2008-04-04

After trying other products, I bought this for the CD Spin Doctor program. It is easy to use and the editing features work very well. <br /> <br />Vinyl conversion is a labor of love - the process is slow, but the end results with CD Spin Doctor are excellent. The program gives you the flexibility to break the recording into separate tracks and to name each one. The tracks can then be imported into iTunes and converted to MP3 (the steps are posted on the Apple website). One flaw - if you cut an album into tracks, they play in alphabetical order, not in the order they were recorded. (Commerically digitized tracks have hidden tags so the songs play in the order they were placed on the CD). <br /> <br />The only knock is that the program crashes on a fairly regular basis. I find, for best results, the entire computer needs to be rebooted frequently, which is VERY uncharacteristic for a Mac.	2005-09-19

I recently installed a new DVD-R drive, which came with something called Nero 7 Essentials.  When I tried to use that program, I found it was only good for 30 days, so I selected the register/upgrade link, which took me to Nero 8.  I purchased that, and that's when the troubles started.  It took forever to download (even at broadband speeds).  The I had to uninstall version 7 (no uninstall program with it).  That also took a long time.  Then the installation of Nero 8 took so long I was beginning to think my computer had frozen.  Once installed, the program takes forever to open (and I have a Pentium 4, 2.8 GHz, and 2 gigs of ram...not a slow system).  Once open, it runs all sorts of call-back programs that tie up the CPU continuously, and you can't kill those without closing the program.  The program takes a lot of space, a lot of memory, and ties up systems resources so completely that nothing else will run.<br /><br />Bottom line...this program stinks...don't touch it!<br /><br />I tried to give this product no stars but the review page wouldn't let me get by with that, so the one star is under protest.<br /><br />UPDATE: I asked the company for a refund (not Amazon), and they refuse to refund my money even though I requested the refund within their 14 day refund period.  Their reason is that I could have downloaded a trial version and tested it.  However, the trial version I downloaded would not function without the registration code.

This allows you to, for example, not only show what's in a spreadsheet cell but how to enter contents, change the formatting, or see the real-time updates on screen. You can then edit your captures (whether still shots or video) to convey exactly the message you want. <br /> <br />SnagIt is very easy to use, but it has another feature that you'll quickly appreciate. That feature is the ability to customize capture profiles that you use frequently. This is not only a great time-saver, but it also helps create a consistent look and feel to your presentations - a good thing when you want your boss or your customers to instantly recognize your work. <br /> <br />In short, SnagIt will add significant value to what you do. At less than $40 it's one of the best software bargains around.	2005-11-02

I purchased this one with the expectation that there would be improvements which would make my usage easier and for the most part this is true. Since I have arthritis in both hands, using Dragon is almost a must for me. My issue is the change which removes dictating into Excel from the standard package. I know that this can be circumvented by using the box to transfer into an unsupported application. I track a number of items including my Quilt Guild Library document using Excel so I can still keep the Excel documents going but it is harder and slower. I wish there was a little greater disclosure of the changes from previous versions. After I had received the new version and realize the change. After that I went back and looked at the inclusion statements and it clearly states that the Excel is included in the Premium version and it does not state that Excel is included in this version, still it was a disappointment.	2013-05-03

Since 1997 and the Macromedia days, Dreamweaver has helped us along the path of building robust web experiences.  The five star rating I have given Dreamweaver CS6 is due to its feature rich development experience, service and support, and wicked user interface, it is sexy.  The program is not for the novice developer looking for a drag and drop application.  Dreamweaver is a developer's tool, and based around what a developer would need in real world applications.  I highly recommend anyone that has not been around web development, or is not familiar with basic CSS and HTML to take step by step tutorials using Dreamweaver's interface.  For example find a YouTube \\"How to write HTML using Dreamweaver\\" video, and go through this tutorial step by step etc.  Dual monitors will be an ally here, so grab yourself another monitor.  Give yourself a little time, and you will most likely end up knowing enough to build an entire website from start to finish!  Dreamweaver has the users needs at heart, and gives unparalleled performance making the developer's life as easy as it can be.  Once again this is a tool for the experienced web developer.  If you are not a developer and you are not inclined or have time to put in to learn,  no problem!  You can always hire one of us!  We are out there, and I can almost guarantee we will be using this tool!  To the Adobe team:  I commend all your valiant efforts in making my and other developers lives so much easier!	2013-08-11

Eset Smart Security 4 has all the potential to be the best internet security suite out there. I'm delighted with the way it reduced my spam in my work mailbox from 100+/day to 2-3, amazing. When browsing and downloading files it does seem to catch and notify me of issues I've never seen other programs do before. I like the fact that it has the ability to customize your firewall protection in almost an infinite amount of ways. That being said, if I can't figure out how to utilize any of its features then they are all essentially useless anyway. I'm not an engineer but I design and build websites so I consider myself to be a pretty advanced computer user. I'm completely baffled by how illogically just the basic user menu is laid out and don't even get me started on the advanced mode. But what really gets me is the fact that when I have actually figured out how to find and change the settings I need Eset will of its own accord change them back after a few days or come up with some other issue of why I can no longer connect to a network or service that I had just created firewall rules for and was WORKING TOTALLY FINE. As for the Anti-virus, while it does inform me about threats when I'm browsing that Norton or others don't it also finds \\"potentially dangerous files\\" of my own that it takes the liberty of deleting without asking me. I can't tell you the number of times I have changed the setting to ask me every time what to do. So despite all Eset could be I would not recommend it to even my worst enemies, not that I really have any. I had purchased a 2-year subscription because of what I heard about this product. After 6 months of constant headaches and frustration I switched to Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 which works great and I highly recommend as an alternative.	2010-09-10

Trend Micro trimmed off anything extra to make this program run as smooth and as fast as possible, using barely any resources.  I highly reccommend this one, it's cheap, but reliable, and most importantly, IT WORKS.	2003-01-14

I bought this from EBay in January 2004, and from what I see today Amazon is offering an excellent price.<br />On first appearance, this software looks to be complciated to learn.  The thing is, they packed it with more features than I personally would ever need.  If you have the patience, you can really get some neat things out of the software.  I played around with it, but eventually discarded the manual and started using it just like my old tape-drive 4-track recorder.  Build-in metronome?  Cool.  Don't need it.  Built-in effects?  Might use it someday.  Not today.  So - you can get off the ground with the basic pretty quickly.  One really neat thing is graphicly selecting regions that you want to punch in before hitting record.  All in all, really good.<br />There are a couple of clunky thing about it that you can work around easily - if you try to record a track before selecting an input device, for example, that track isn't going to work again (so just deleted it and make a new one).  Double-clicking a Cakewalk file from file explorer results in an error, so bring up the application first, then load the file.  I haven't run into any really drastic bugs, but makes me wonder when I will.<br />Okay - my big beef - you have to pay extra to enable mixing down to MP3.  I personally find it very obnoxious to buy a fully-featured, production piece of software - and then they want MORE MONEY - $30 - to enable what should be a standard feature.  You can mix down to plenty of formats, sure, but let's face it, you'd expect MP3 to be a pretty standard format to use.  I feel cheated and not respected as a customer of the product when the developers resort to this kind of money-grubbing.<br />Well, I was going to give 2 starts because of the MP3 thing, but to be fair, overall this is a really nice piece of software, so it deserves a balanced review.  Happy recording!	2004-07-17

There's two parts: the computer program and the audio discs. <br /> <br />The Computer Prgram is the reason I rated this software a little low.  The most irritating part was the \\"voice recognition.\\"  I thought that MAYBE my pronunciation had suffered, so I cheated and recorded the guy speaking in the program.  IT STILL DIDN'T WORK.  There was only one case of this - the rest I was able to say on my own and pass the recognition part. <br /> <br />The eight audio CDs are pretty good and comprehensive though.  My only complaint was the overpronunciation of the last syllables of some words.  For example, they stress the last \\"t\\" in J'habite enough that it sounds like they're pronouncing the last \\"e\\" which SHOULD remain silent. <br /> <br />I would still recommend this program to anyone who has a couple years background in French and wants to refresh their knowledge of the language - even expand their vocabulary a bit.  However, if someone is new to the language, I would look elsewhere.	2005-10-19

I used the yellow brand for several years, and it was initially fine, but every upgrade got more and more bloated.  So I did some research and switched to an up and coming brand in a red box.  That year it worked great, like so many reviews had said.  My computers got their speed back, and no annoying pop-ups.  But then the upgrade came along the next year, and the pop-ups got annoying again.  So this year, I did some more research, and from what I read, NOD32 looked like the best combination of accurate virus detection, low system load, invisible operation, and reasonable price.  So far, I have found those reviews to be true.  It was quick and easy to install, has had no noticeable effect on system resources, and does what it is supposed to do quietly in the background.  ESET seems to know what they are doing, and so far I am very pleased.	2009-01-26

This is my second attempt at learning Japanese.  I have tried instant immersion before, and by comparison, rosetta is way easier to use.  It does a great job with getting your attention, and through interaction you do not get boared of memorizing lists of words.  I was skeptical of learning to read, but it starts you off slowly and builds you up.  even though there is no english narration of any kind, the pictures make it very simple to learn.  I have first learned of rosetta while I was in the army, and decided to give it a shot.  It is way more expensive than instant emmersion, and may have a lot less features, but it works 1000% better (not a scientific statistic, but you get the picture.)    If you ever wanted to learn a new language, I thing it is the best program out there.  After a week, I know words, and can somewhat form simple sentences, as well as recognizing very few characters, but it is level 1 after all, and I did not even get half way with it.  Enjoy speaking a new language, and be sattisfied.	2008-09-03

And charging money for it?<br /><br />10-15 years ago a product like this was absolutely necessary.  Today's both Macs and PC's come with media playback software and photo management tools that do exactly the same thing as almost everything PowerDVD does. The only result I could see is it includes a few minor features for enhancing playback quality.  Again, years ago that may have been cool, but today the vast majority of people who will watch movies will do so on their high-resolution flat-screen TV, or their tablet PC (or even smartphone).  I can't see much of a market anymore for software to help watch DVD's on a computer.<br /><br />On my desktop system it seemed to bog down system resources so after I evaluated it I uninstalled it.

The other features--including word processor, spreadsheet, slideshow creator, video, etc. are the same and the design is similar to microsoft office.

In my experience, it did neither. (I am running Dragon 6 Preferred on an XP Pro machine using Word 2002 and Outlook 2002.)<br />Within an hour of use, I began having a problem in which Dragon declined to capitalize the first word of a sentence and failed to put a space between words. Resort to ScanSoft's technical support site was dismaying. Contacting a technician by e-mail costs $10. Contacting one by phone is $20. I don't know about you, but I feel that after spending $160+ on a program, and running into a major bug after only an hour of use, I ought to get some free tech support.<br />Okay, so then I went to the technical notes section. Tried multiple searches. Nothing. Finally started scrolling through the list of recent tech notes. (A depressingly long list, I might add.) I found a recent tech note addressing the words run together problem, which included many of the search terms I had used in the search engine. Why the search engine did not pick this note up, I still don't know. In any event, the note required me to download Service Pack 1. Then it turned out that Service Pack 1 was only for Dragon Pro, not Dragon preferred. Hence, ScanSoft has NO fix for my problem.<br />Additional problems developed thereafter: The \\"Select and Say\\" and Correct functions stopped working in Word 2002. Dragon turns out to basically not be usable in Outlook 2002 unless you use Word as your editor, which then means you lose the correction function. This makes it almost impossible to correct mistakes, let alone train Dragon to improve its accuracy.	2002-08-06

This is year 2 for me for Kaspersky.  Love the software, it works fine and is much less of a \\"resource hog\\" than Norton I.S. which we used for the prior 10 years or so.  That's the good news.<br /><br />Here's the bad news.  The support from Kaspersky is subcontracted to Digital River and their Manila call center.  If you buy from Amazon, they will ask for your Kaspersky order number.  No Kaspersky order number, no assistance.  Period.  So, you are getting \\"Support-less\\" software when you buy it here.  I found this shocking.  My only question was where I had used 2 of the 3 seats or all 3 seats, since I had recently bought a new desktop, installed the software, but returned it due to a defect in the PC.  NO ONE AT DIGITAL RIVER COULD ANSWER MY SIMPLE QUESTION.  NOR DID THEY SEEM WILLING TO HELP.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that Amazon needs to look into this situation, because Kaspersky has instructed their call center not to assist customers who buy KIS software on Amazon.  It's as if it were counterfeit software.  So, IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT EVER NEED SUPPORT, AT ANY TIME, then pay a few $$ more and buy this on the Kaspersky website, or get Norton Internet Security instead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I hope that Amazon Customer Service will look into this issue.  It is simple to verify what I have stated, just call the toll free number for Kaspersky support and ask them.	2014-01-29

(I've done about 35 tests since then)  - Once, when I was in the middle of \\"Intermediate Training\\", I was kicked right back into \\"Beginner Training\\" -- not to help me with my skills, but as a bug (there was no record of all the work that I'd done to that point).  After restarting the program a number of times... and then completing a couple of beginner tests, suddenly all my info returned?!?!    I have no idea if the older versions of MBTT fare better, but be warned: IF YOU BUY THIS SOFTWARE FOR THE MAC YOU WILL FIND BUGS!!!    I contacted Technical Support about these issues (and more) and received no response.  I'm returning the product for a refund.    I'd give it 0 stars if I could.	2010-11-01

The National Geographic has many amazing articles and photo spreads and is, or perhaps was, one of the best. A couple of drawbacks however in this CD-Rom collection is the scan resolution. It appears not to have been high enough! My eyes can just plain hurt trying to read some of the issues pages because the words are murky. Then, of course, some of those earlier years weren't that interesting, frankly. The magazine definitely got better as time went on. There is something much more satisfying by actually thumbing through a real magazine and looking at the pictures than trying to do this on CD-Rom.

I was too eager to upgrade from Adobe Photoshop 5.0 Limited Edition for the advertised price of $159.95 (Amazon's ad clearly says \\"any version;\\" and Amazon definitely is an *authorized reseller* of new Adobe software unless it is an auction situation).  Initially Adobe confirmed that I was entitled to upgrade for that price so I went ahead and placed the order with Amazon.  Bottom line is that to upgrade I would need to spend $499!  Not what I agreed to at all . . .  So I wasted a lot of time and got upset and ended up with zilch.     IMPORTANT UPDATE:  The situation was resolved to my satisfaction and I received an apology from Adobe and also in the *future* the advertising for this product is supposed to be clarified so that potential purchasers understand what versions can be upgraded for the price of $159.95 and what version will need a significantly more expensive upgrade.  I would also like to add that although I think Amazon is a fantastic company and I've done a lot of business with them your remedy with Amazon is limited to a full 100%  cost free refund, which is wonderful, but doesn't help when you want to receive what you paid for.  Bottom line is that I would do business with Amazon and I strongly prefer to buy from Amazon and also I would continue doing business with Adobe.	2006-06-01

I just felt compelled to go around giving it negative reviews today after, for the second time in about three months, Windows decided it was time to update.  Updating on Windows Vista isn't like on your other systems, where you choose whether or not to download it and it installs when you reset your machine.  Windows Vista doesn't even prompt you about what it's doing, it just resets your machine automatically, no matter what you have open, no matter what you're working on, no warnings, nothing.  Everything just closes (without saving or creating a backup), the screen goes black, then blue, then half an hour later boots up again to tell you oh by the way your system was just updated, in case you didn't notice.    I thought it was some glitch on my machine, or some odd setting I must have turned on by accident, certainly not the factory default, until my friend's computer did the exact same thing later that day.  This has happened twice to me now.    I have no idea how Microsoft can follow up their best operating system to date with their worst, but it happened.  I've still got one computer with XP loaded on it, pray nothing happens to it before they release 7.	2009-04-17

Sometimes this can do things Acrobat can't or it does them a bit better. I had to scan a high school yearbook with about 1,000 student photos and the names listed separately (e.g., a column of 6 photos with 6 names underneath). I found this was better than Acrobat at not jumbling the names together.  They both were amazing in their OCR accuracy on surnames but PDF Converter Pro would keep the hard return for each line, meaning I didn't have to manually re-add them. Also, PDF Converter Pro lets you select part of a page and run OCR on just that, which was incredibly useful since there were multiple name columns at the bottom of the page and I needed each name on a separate line.<br /><br />Also, I found that Acrobat couldn't OCR light solid-color text on a dark solid-color background but PDF Converter Pro could. Additionally, if a page contains text from a wordprocessor, etc., (i.e., the underlying document contains a combination of the wordprocessor's format and images of text) Acrobat won't OCR the page--it will give an error that OCR can't be run on the page because it contains \\"renderable text\\". Converter Pro will simply OCR the part that isn't \\"renderable text\\".<br /><br />Just about every time I run the program the activation dialog pops up and I click Activate Now. A Nuance Customer Service rep mentioned in one reply to another comment that version 7.3 corrects that.  I emailed Nuance and they sent me a (temporary) link to download 7.3, which I installed that corrected the problem. There is no service pack or patch on the website or through Check for Updates that takes the software from 7.2 to 7.3.  The download link is for a full-install 1.5GB DVD.	2012-06-07

Most of you reading this have heard of, or are using a version of Photoshop. That alone attests to its popularity. And you know the basics. The single most powerful raster graphics program around, made more powerful and flexible by the number of plug-ins available. <br />What's new:<BR>&quot;Vector shapes&quot; - a little misleading in its meaning. Indeed they are vector shapes, but when saved, they are rasterized. Maybe future versions will integrate the fundamentals of Illustrator (or Freehand - both the best vector graphics programs available) a little better. But the shapes feature is quite useful for logos, and small icons. <br />Editable text effects - Not quite &quot;text on a path,&quot; but a very welcome feature. After skewing the text with this feature, you are still able to alter font styles/sizes/colors with no problem.  <br />Dockable Palettes - a great feature, if you have a large enough monitor (17&quot; w/high-resolution setting, 19&quot; w/mid-res setting), in order to see the dock. Allows you to place heavily used palettes in the upper right hand section, without having to move them around. <br />It has quite a few more feature, but those I've mentioned are my favorites. Coming from 5.0 to 5.5 was fairly unimpressive, but the jump to 6.0 has made it a worthwhile upgrade.	2001-09-18

The Privacy Cleaner thoroughly removes any junk files that slow down your computer. Although I use Iobit Advanced SystemCare as my main program to maintain my RAM, Kaspersky's Privacy Cleaner does a good job of cleaning the junk leftovers. A new Cloud Protection has been added and I find it nice that my computer is also protected whenever I download from Cloud services.<br /><br />Needs Improvement:  The Full Scan can find hidden viruses, but not all of them. I've used numerous of internet security Programs such as Norton, Panda, Spybot: Search & Destroy, Malwarebytes, and Trend Micro, but I decided to take a leap on Kaspersky since it's been highly rated for many years. In comparison to the other programs, Kaspersky's Full Scan is not effective as it should be. Yes it will find malware and other viruses, but I always use another program afterwards and find more viruses in my computer even when I have scanned in Safe Mode and rebooted the system.<br /><br />Mediocre: Although Safe Money is a useful add-on to protect from spyware while using your online bank, it still has glitches that makes it quite annoying to use. As soon as you go to your bank's website, a Kaspersky window pops up and offers you to use Safe Money. Depending your browser, Kaspersky can slow down your internet and freeze your internet browser. Another thing is that your browser might freeze at your online banking's login because Kaspersky tracks while typing your username and password.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Kaspersky works as an internet security protection if you're inexperienced with computers. The menu easy to use and its interface is visually appealing. Other security programs might have a better virus scanner than this one does, but the add-on's make up for it. If you're looking for entry-level security program that is low cost online, then feel free to give this one a try.y-level security program that is low cost online, then feel free to give this one a try.	2014-12-09

I am preparing for a rebuild and was looking for a backup program that would do normal backups, differential backups, and scheduled differential backups. XP backup (ntbackup) works well but I had to create a password for my Windows logon so booting up always took two steps. The only reason I installed a Norton program on my hard drive was because I am replacing the drive. Using this program reminded me why I gave up on Norton a few years ago. Why is this program so large? It doesn't really do that much. It does much less than some of the smaller programs I tried. Just the \\"updater\\" took several minutes to download and two re-boots. That wasn't an error; it just took that much time and work. I used to see the \\"updater\\" screen often when I had my last Norton product and this was not a pleasant reminder. This program is not user friendly and specifying files and folders in not intuitive. This program specializes in file \\"types\\" (photos, music, etc.) I am supposed to trust Norton to select which files I am going to back up. Yeah, right. It does not even perform differential backups. Performing a search for \\"differential\\" in help yielded no results. StorageSync works well for syncing and non-compressed files but had no scheduling capabilities. Nero seemed difficult to use, and did not spend much time with it because it changes the restored file dates to the restore date. Genie worked well but had no differential and scheduling requires a password. Acronis TrueImage also requires a password for scheduling. Handy Backup got hung up on in-use files and had no differential backup. My favorite is Cyberlink PowerBackup. TurboBackup was my second favorite. It had some extra features but PowerBackup did everything I needed and was just a little more user friendly.	2007-12-22

But, it's also more than that.  This is a faithful adaptation of Jules Verne's original story Around The World In Eighty Days, and the story plays out as you advance through levels of tile matching.  With beautiful animated backgrounds of London, Paris, India, China and more.., completion of each level results in more of the story being told in the game journal book, and the introduction of new characters.  There is intrigue as Phileas Fogg ( the gentleman making the journey...) is being followed by a sinister character who wants to stop him from completing the journey.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is very smooth and fluid, the tiles move quickly when you click on them and there are tools you can gain that are very helpful in completing the boards.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that the screensaver feature offered by the game doesn't seem to function properly.  It's a separate feature you can access which bascially allows you to use any of the animated backgrounds of the various locations as a screensaver for your computer.  I was not able to get this feature to activate.  However I was able to work-around it, by activating the \\"preview\\" of the screensaver , within the game, and just leave it running in that state.<br /><br />But that one complaint is very minor and detracts nothing from the enjoyment of the game itself.  I highly recommend it.  The complexity and challenge of the tile matching boards increases gradually as you advance through the levels, but it's never too difficult to complete.<br /><br />- Mike S.	2010-05-31

From the start it was evident that Expression Studio was vastly different from Frontpage. Although it is undoubtedly more powerful, I was dismayed to learn that my Frontpage web files are not even loadable into ES without extensive modifications, something that has proven just too difficult to overcome. I administer multiple web sites, and the learning curve here just looks way too steep for me. So I've resolved to stick with Frontpage strictly as a page editor for now until I find something more usable.  Everything seems to be moving toward web based applications now, and that seems a better way to go than proprietary Windows software. So, while ES may be a good product, for me, it's just a poor investment.	2013-01-05

I have been using it for several years now.  I love how simple it makes large projects.  For example, at Christmas time I made 30+ photo books for gifts and MMS (My Memory Suite) made it so simple.  MMS has an option to use pre-designed template packs and those designs can be altered to fit your own style and needs - nothing is set in stone.  I simply chose a design and used that as my base for the book and then added and changed things to fit my style.  I love it.  If you can send an email you can create amazing designs and projects with this software.  I would recommend this to anyone who digi-scraps and anyone who is thinking about digi-scrapping.	2010-05-25

Please note that this is the spanish standard version; just spanish. Although I had resisted the temptation to try out an application such as this because of comments received regarding the lack of accuracy in speech recognition programs, after reading the highlights and accuracy hype of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking, I finally decided to try it out. To my surprise, so far I have found it to be true. It is very accurate recognizing with an effective learning process. Even though I have been using it for less than a month, I am well satisfied. So far the use I have put it to use is preparing legal documents and my wife's college term papers. The only thing that perhaps has caused me some trouble is the commands use to \\"move around\\" the documents; they work, but you have to be careful pronouncing them because if not, the program just writes down what you have said, instead of moving down a line or going to the end of the document as you wanted, for example. Other than that, and that the Help system although reasonably comprehensive, should be augmented, it is a very good product and I recommended it. But remember, just spanish.	2007-11-29

With the amazon.com price of about 60$, you can't go wrong.<BR>Adobe Photoshop Elements v2.0 is aimed at being a relatively cheap priced program that can be used to create simple graphics and edit photos/pictures (even web graphics).  This program does it flawlessly.<br />First off, this program is just a &quot;toned-down&quot; version of Adobe Photoshop.  Having said that, this still offers a wide range of features that the average person will find overwhelming.  Because it is based off of photoshop, this has some great features such as Selecting, layers, photo touch-up, color adjustments and transperency; the same Exact ones that are in photoshop!<br />The sad fact is that, most computers eaither come with no image editing software, or very little such as microsoft Picture It!.  Also, i have looked at several digital cameras and seen the software that comes with them.  I am very dissapointed with it.  Basically these are just ment to quickly crop, edit colors, add text, and transfer the pictures from the camera to the computer.   Adobe Elements v2.0 does all this, and better!<br />If you recently bought a digital camera, have the need to create simple web graphics, or want to touch up previous pictures this is your best bet.  Jasc Paint Shop Pro is another alternitive, but i prefer the Adobe elements.<BR>The documentation is very &quot;cryptic&quot;, and does not &quot;teach&quot;.  There are a ton of tutorials though online for FREE provided by adobe which offer a hands-on approach to learing many of the features of Elements.  Something Paint Shop Pro does not excell at.  Also, there are a lot of books writen on elements 2.0 that will teach people how to use Elements.<br />I will be honest, if you have NEVER used any photo-editing software, and do not know the basics of how to use a computer, you will find yourself lost!  In that case, i 100% recommend you get a book to accompany this software.  It might take you a while to learn the in's-and-out's of how to usethis software to its fullest, but once you do you will be able to do amazing things.<br />But, what sets Adobe Elements away from the competition is that Most Adobe products &quot;act the same&quot;.  What i mean by this is that, the &quot;the magic wand tool&quot; that is found in other adobe products is the same exact one in elements.  This is true for most of the features and tools that Adobe products have.  This helps make the transition over from other adobe products very effortless, in-case you have worked with other products or plan on working with other adobe products.<br />I have used several adobe products, including GoLive6, Photoshop 7, Illustrator 10, Indesign2, and have experimented with other's as well.  I am very impressed at what these can do; granted that some are expensive, they do amazing things!<br />The only major downfall, is that Adobe makes you sign their end-user liscense agreement, which basically states that Adobe is not liable for any damage or lose of data done to your computer ... EVEN IF THEY KNEW IT WOULD, a very disapointing thing from such a large company!<br />To sum up:<BR>If you are looking for a fairly simple software program to edit and touch up photos, and even create a few of your own(at a relitively cheap price), Elements v2.0 should be your best bet.<br />I recommend you goto [...] and download the 30-day trial version before buying it.  Give it a shot for a few days, see how it works, and if you like it, i would recommend you get it!<br />~Hope this helps!	2003-10-12

I hesitated getting Quicken Essentials because of all the complaints on here about it missing all kinds of features. Because we were moving to OS X Lion shortly, I wanted to go ahead and try QE as it is Lion compatable and we needed to convert our old Quicken files with the Conversion program provided by Intuit before installing Lion. I bought QE and converted the old files and imported into QE. My wife then tried it and said it looks newer, and has switched with nary a complaint. So if you just need a home accounting program and liked old Quicken for that then QE will continue to fill the bill. Just remember to convert the old files prior to switching to Lion. If you don't already have old files then QE is running fine under Lion and it is my Wife's favorite.	2011-07-23

However as an [[ASIN:B001EUBSL0 Adobe Photoshop]] fan, I doubted Corel Painter would be a replacement.  Even though I was right, I completely misunderstood the purpose of this powerful software.<br /><br />The Corel Painter 11 software is a tool used to create digital paintings and sketches.  While intended for painters and sketch artists, Corel also recognizes possibilities for photographers.  During a visit to the Corel website I quickly located a tutorial showing how to auto create a painting from a photograph.  This option is surprisingly good (see the Olives at Market image), but has its limitations.  I knew I could create better paintings by learning the program and painting to my liking.<br /><br />At first glance this software looks complicated.  The basic appearance of the toolbox, palettes, and layout with all the drop downs and color mixer can be intimidating to a non-painter like me.  However after spending a little time clicking and testing, I realized Corel Painter 11 uses familiar Photoshop type icons and has similar functionalities like layers.  This familiarity helped decrease the learning curve, allowing me time to focus on the things I didn't understand.<br /><br />After reviewing all the brushes, color mixer, and a few other things that I couldn't easily relate to, I decided to take a course at betterphoto.com.  The first lesson gave me a basic understanding of how to create a pastel painting from an image.  I also realized quickly how much fun it was to paint my images, especially using my [[ASIN:B001TUYTZW Intuos4 pen tablet]].  By the time I finished the fourth lesson, I had created five paintings (all displayed in the images section) and developed a strong foundation for future projects.<br /><br />For those familiar with previous versions, several brushes are missing in Corel Painter 11.  The Flemish Rub brush is one I used but had to manually install.  If a favorite brush is missing or you want to experiment with some alternatives, place the install disc in the drive and browse to Extras > Brushes.  Then drag the brushes you want into the appropriate Corel Painter folder on your hard drive.  Some of the newer functions may not work with an older brush, which is probably why they didn't come pre-installed.  However these brushes are still useful even if they are limited in their abilities.<br /><br />While it's clear this is a feature rich painter software tool with the versatility to work for various artists, it won't be for everyone.  If this is the type of software you would enjoy, Corel Painter 11 is an excellent choice worthy of the expense.  If you are uncertain, look for the free trial download at Corel's website.  The expense of taking a class at betterphoto.com isn't necessary either; there are plenty of reasonably priced books and free web tutorials.  However, I would strongly recommend investing in a pen tablet set if you don't own one already.  You could get by without one, but you'll miss out on the sensitivity and angle functions as well as make painting unnecessarily challenging.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Toolbar icons and functions similar to Photoshop<br />Fun and creative way to make paintings from photos<br /><br />CONS:<br />Steep pricevorite brush is missing or you want to experiment with some alternatives, place the install disc in the drive and browse to Extras > Brushes.

I've been watching Quicken reviews degrade over the past four years since I had Quicken 2000.  I was very happy with that version and hesitant to upgrade based on what I had been reading.  But since Intuit cut off support for online updates for Quicken 2000, and since the reviews for Quicken 2005 weren't quite as horrible as those for the past four years, I figured it was time to bite the bullet.  Well, I've been very happy so far.  I've haven't encountered any bugs with the latest upgrade and the product is relatively advertisement free...this seems to have been a plaguing problem in versions 2001-2004.  2005 is highly configurable and upgraded very smoothly from my 2000 version.

I've used this program for many years so I don't use their EasyStep interview process which makes entry much faster for me, but if you are a novice the EasyStep process is really helpful to identify issues that relate to your unique tax situation.  What makes this program worth the price for anyone with rental property is its ability to handle depreciation calculations accurately and to use it to carryover depreciation deductions from year to year.  Also, since I bought it from Amazon I paid $5 less for the Premier version than I would have paid for the Deluxe version locally and got free shipping with Prime!  You must buy the Premier version for the extra guidance with rental and investment income.  For Schedule C assistance you need the Home and Business edition.  Free federal e-file is included with all versions, but they do charge for e-filing your state taxes which you don't need TurboTax to do for you, so I just skip it and file State taxes via my State's website.  In addition to actually completing the tax forms for you accurately, the program also provides you with a searchable database of tax information and other tax guidance.	2013-04-28

I have constantly used it in recording situations and it is accessible everywhere. I'll say a couple of words about it: it's very versatile, but don't get into it if you don't have a tutor. Pro Tools is fantastic for those who understand working with professional DAW's. If you're a newbie, get something like Reaper (it's free) and save until you get a good education for this line of work. You won't be able to maximize the program until you understand signal routing/bussing/assigning, etc.<br /><br />For those of you who DO understand this, it's got some awesome advantages. The new clip (previously called region) gain is an awesome tool for post-production. Let me point that out as well, Pro Tools 10 has a lot of features that are great for POST. But that doesn't mean there's nothing for the general use of it. The new 32-bit float is awesome (but, again, probably more frequently used in post) and you also have access DIRECTLY all the way to 192kHz sampling-rate. No more Pro Tools HD needed to go that high. There is no input-monitoring for individual tracks, like in HD, but that's okay. This is a great advantage. I was killing myself that I would have to get HD to use an interface that had the capabilities to go to 192, but no more. No more 192 racks! Now, for HD, that's a different story - Avid has made their NEW hardware (which is bull - since you MUST get the hardware for HD to work. The old technology up to Pro Tools 9 will NOT work for Pro Tools HDX).<br /><br />In a general scope, I had Pro Tools 8 LE before I upgraded. It was a good choice for me. It may not be for others depending (specifically!) on your hardware. I HIGHLY recommend checking your compatibility to the software before you buy it.<br /><br />Oh, and let me also recommend this: if you're wondering how much \\"horsepower\\" you need for Pro Tools, I also HIGHLY recommend at least 8GB Ram. I started with 4GB to see how efficient it would be with a lower amount of RAM (Avid recommends 4 or more)... well... GET MORE. I immediately bumped up my RAM and boom - big difference. Don't kid yourself. Make your life easier and invest into good hardware and a solid computer system. Shortcuts get the short end of the stick!GET MORE.

I want to know how to prevent that from happening.<br />Ernan: I'm sorry about that. Inorder to avoid that to happen you may purchase the most updated version of quicken so that you can use the software up until 3 year before it will be unsupported.<br />You: You are not answering my question.  It's obvious you don't understand what I'm asking.  I don't know how to make it any more clear. You have not been helpful.  I will not purchase an upgrade.	2015-02-07

We are using Win 7 64 bit w/ QB Contractor version; however, the reported crashing with fatal unrecoverable errors in QB 2013 seems to appear in various versions from Enterprise to Pro.<br /><br />Intuit issued multiple warnings to users concerning discontinuing support of prior QB Payroll versions.  New Payroll releases would be compatible with QB 2011 - 2013; thus many businesses were forced to upgrade from functioning 2010 releases and are presently experiencing multiple fatal errors with QB 2013.  You might want to wait for Intuit resolve this issue ... the general consensus suggests that recent QB \\"fixes\\" have made matters worse.<br /><br />Update 01/23/2014 - Still encountering fatal errors w/ QB 2013.

But version 3.0 caught my eye with a whole new slew of enticing enhancements, of which \\"makes bootable CD or DVD\\" proved the clincher.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, I was saved from uninstalling the old-timer by first checking the printed instruction booklet. Turns out that the bootable media claim is correct indeed, but its capabilities are strictly limited to copying a bootable floppy disk [what's that?] from the floppy disk drive, and Fireman would bravely fire away and burn the image to CD/DVD. WOW! Not a word about copying from hard drive, let alone generating, an *.iso system file - this super-duper feature is limited strictly to floppies. As I neither own a bootable floppy nor a floppy drive (those went out in the 90's), I didn't even bother to install Fireman, and tossed forty bucks into the trash can.

Snow Leopard definitely feels faster than the previous OS. Boot up and shut down times are faster as well. I haven't had any incompatibility issues with snow leopard. My printer (HP C4480)is also working fine, this including printing and scanning. However, prior to installing snow leopard, I uninstalled any HP driver/software that was installed. I let snow leopard take care of the printer drivers. I also noticed that my battery life on my white macbook (early 2008) has increased after installing snow leopard. I have been using 10.6 for a little over 3 weeks now and it is very stable. Ejecting the drives is faster as well. The new expose is great and easy to use. Quicktime X is nice, however, it might be a CPU hog at times. There is certainly a color pop since 10.6 uses gamma 2.2. Things look brighter and very pleasant. After installation, give your computer some time to get to it's full speed since it will be doing some indexing. I would recommend snow leopard because of the cheap upgrade price. Just make sure to have a complete system backup just in case anything goes wrong. Upgrade to 10.6.1 after installation to avoid some issues that were present with 10.6.0.	2009-09-29

You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc. The program includes, in recommended order of use:<br /><br />1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases. It can also be downloaded onto an iPod.<br /><br />The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run. These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod -<br />2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM<br />3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM<br />4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM<br />5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM<br />6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM<br />7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM<br /><br />8) \\"Talk More\\" Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate<br />9) \\"Who is Oscar Lake\\" CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i.e. Nancy Drew, etc)<br /><br />The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they don't really match the rest of the class.<br /><br />I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan.<br /><br />I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher. In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.<br /><br />This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older!

You have built a brand with us long-time users; so much so that I just tossed TurboTax Deluxe into my cart.  What long-time customer trusting reads the bullet points for warnings that the product has been crippled?    You moved basic features into a much more expensive version instead of having the guts to move each product to the price point Intuit desired. I don't have complicated taxes.  Just some stocks and a 401k in an E*Trade account.  I always paid for the \\"Deluxe\\" version over the simple or free version for its features.  And it always did the job.  So it is very off-putting that it no longer does.  One shouldn't need a \\"premier\\" or business product because they own a few stocks.  Especially when \\"deluxe\\" used to serve their needs    Your explanation was insulting to the intelligence.  This was because people were confused?  Really?  What could be more confusing than this stupid move?  Any reasonable person could tell you that you don't cripple the produce and keep the same name.  It feels deceptive and sleezy, whether intended or not.    So this year, you will get a lot of people feeling trapped into upgrading because it's too much hassle or too late to go after other options.  Next year, you will lose many of them.  I saw the reviews in time, so I'll be trying something else this year.  Goodbye.	2015-01-12
US	49800759	R1AERD8HWU83B5	B00IVFDZBC	329906799	CorelDraw X7	Software	3	30	36	Y	N	But can it really deal with your old Adobe CS files?	Anyone who's been following the software market knows that Adobe shot itself in the foot with its new rent-to-not-own software pricing scheme. And anyone who's evaluated this Corel suite knows that Corel has set out to eat Adobe's lunch. Not only does the software take in Adobe files, CorelDraw offers a \\"workspace\\" that emulates the look and feel of Illustrator, and Photopaint offers a similar workspace for Photoshop, as well as some recently added path-friendly capabilities. Searching for Adobe on the Corel site turns up much advice on how to handle the transition.<br /><br />So, how well does the Corel suite really handle Adobe files?<br /><br />* ILLUSTRATOR TO CorelDRAW *<br /><br />I prepared a file in Illustrator (CS5) with two art boards, two main layers, and eight sub-layers (some were created on the fly as I added text). Into this project I placed a daring spline-defined squiggle, some gradient-filled shapes, and text in both Arial italic (which both programs offer), and Accent SF, which is only available in Adobe programs. I saved the file as an Illustrator file (.ai).<br /><br />Upon first opening the file in CorelDraw, I was informed that Accent SF was unavailable, and offered the option of replacing all instances with another font (one was suggested), either this one time, or in general. All text remained editable, as did the shapes and the squiggle, including re-splining. All good. (The Corel site offers more complete information about what kinds of effects are brought forward, and what isn't).<br /><br />While the content translation was good, however, the workspace translation was not. The art boards were transformed into pages, which in Corel are tabbed, not side-by-side, and the main layers were retained, but not the sublayers. Most people won't care. Wizard-level Illustrator users will be frustrated. (Using the Adobe-style workspace doesn't really help, though \\"page sorter view\\" will show you all your pages).<br /><br />* PHOTOSHOP TO PHOTOPAINT *<br /><br />To test the Photoshop/Photopaint transition, I prepared an eight-layer drawing in Photoshop from my CS5 package, in 32-bit RGB (Corel offers 24 and 48 bit), including one weird spline-based curve, and using some hard-to-replicate glows and shading, and some text again in Arial and Accent SF.  I rasterized and smudged some of the text in one layer just to be ornery, and stretched the text in another. Then I saved the file in native (.psd) Photoshop mode.<br /><br />Opening the file in Photopaint, I was delighted to see a very accurate rendering of the original, somewhat brighter, and now in 48-bit (one of the choices for color here is \\"Adobe RGB.\\" Bravo). Corel's \\"What the font\\" feature even managed to identify the Accent SF font, with a little help from an online database. Editing the text was another story. Maybe because Photopaint opened the file as the background? Corel's Help file counseled me to use \\"Import\\" instead. Ok. Nope. I still got only one Photopaint \\"object\\" (what Photoshop calls a \\"layer,\\" according to Photopaint Help, though there isn't really a 1:1 correlation here). Using the magic wand mask tool let me (tediously) separate the graphics into separate layers/objects, but (maddeningly) left some drop shadows behind, and the text was still unrecognized. Yet, the Photopaint help file says that Adobe text is imported as a text object, and therefore editable? Well, I did visually alter some of the text, and Corel doesn't like that. Maybe if I saved each text layer as its own file? I give up.<br /><br />* OTHER TRANSLATIONS *<br /><br />Just for grins, I opened the Photoshop file in CorelDraw, which produced an error message suggesting I use \\"Import\\" instead. Kudos to Corel. Importing, however, produced the same problems (no separate layers/objects, so no ability to select or edit text), as well as some awful distortions. Opening the Illustrator file in Paintshop Pro (X5) gave me a nice rendering, and I could then use the magic wand tool to salvage the graphics, though the text was a lost cause. Unfortunately, Paintshop Pro isn't part of this package. (Further online research indicates the best option may in fact be Corel Painter, which I unfortunately don't own).<br /><br />* CONCLUSION *<br /><br />Overall, I think this Corel suite will be useful for general users who don't want to (repeatedly) shell out absurd amounts of money for Adobe software. Real high-end graphic artists who want to continue to be able to access their own work, done in Adobe, are between a rock and a hard place. Adobe is in the process of alienating the entire industry, and Corel doesn't quite cut it (yet...).	2014-06-12

US	32750018	R27YTKVFTY3HP4	B00WR547HS	441271737	Order of Battle: Pacific	Software	4	9	9	N	N	A very good new hex-based Strategy Game	At first glance, this game looks very similar to Panzer General/Panzer Corps, but its not merely an offshoot of these games, but tries to add new elements to the known concept. Most of this works, and for any fan of these games - thats my summary - adds a fresh breeze into the genre and is totally worth playing it.<br />Now to the details:It features three single player campaigns - a tutorial (American side), a Japanese, and an american campaign. There also some multiplayer scenarios, while you have too unlock the single player scenarios by playing the campaign through.<br />LIke Panzer Corps, its an operational game - you have a unit core where you can buy infantry, tanks, Artillery and so on and move and attack around hexes. In most scenarios, you operate with land, sea and air units alike, but some - like the famous battles of Coral Sea and Midway - are naval/ar battles. In the land battles, there are the most differences to Panzer Corps. The most important among many differences is that - like, for example in Unity of Command - you have to maintain supply lines to keep your units performance strong. Also, units suffer from battle attrition and need to take a break sometimes to perform at their full strength again. So, especially on the offensive, you need to plan ahead a lot.<br />The sea battles are very different. Here, there a big differences how to use destroyers, the big surface ships, submarines. Like in the real pacific war, the game changers are your carrier planes and most sea battles deal with that you assign them the right way and also anticipate what the enemy will do with his planes.<br />Similar to &#34;Afrika Korps&#34;, an expansion of &#34;Panzer Corps&#34;, the maps have plenty of special events if you achieve or miss secondary mission goals. For example, if you shoot down enough japanese planes in the battle of Pearl Harbour as the U.S., there will be a decline in experience for Japanese air crews in future the scenarios. These events are forme the best thing in the game and add a little surprise to the battles.<br />For this genre, Order of Battle has relatively good graphics.<br />I would rate OOB four stars, because there are some cons for me. Otherwise it would be a perfect strategy game.<br />The main thing is that it is not a very beginner friendly game. Not even because its so difficult, but of presentation Issues. I think for someone who is new to these kind of games, its sometimes hard to figure out how some concepts work. There is a huge tutorial, but even there it starts to get complex very soon while some things, especially attrition and the supply system, are not properly explained.<br />I also think the game needs still some balancing, an issue that is adressed sometimes in the discussion forums on Steam or the Slitherine site. One example: Its strange, but dive bombers are too &#34;weak&#34; to attack tanks properly while they were used for it a lot on the war.<br />The campaings are linear and in many cases you fight with both sides on the same theatre. I would have liked to have a little more variety here and that you could chose between different campaing paths., but I am pretty sure that will be done in the future in expansions.	2015-06-29

I am Japanese American myself but am ashamed to say pretty much the only Japanese I know is being able to order from a menu, or else the more impolite words like \\"bakatare\\" (stupid) or \\"yakamashi\\" (loudmouth) or \\"monku\\" (complaining.. hence the \\"monkuboy\\" moniker, haha). While my friends went to Japanese school on Saturday mornings I resisted and my parents never forced me so I learned nothing. However, I bet everyone who went forgot how to speak or understand it anyway so we all wound up at the same place.    Regarding this program: The box is impressively heavy. It installed without a hitch using the accurate instructions, though it did take a fairly long time. The headset installed without a hitch also - I use Windows XP and it recognized the device right away and the first test with the software was successful.  It is a rather flimsy headset so you have to treat it gently.  Also, make sure you turn down the volume on your PC before using it because the voices are LOUD.     The lessons are pleasant to take and the sessions last about half an hour which seems about right to digest things. Even though most of it is intuitive as far as what to do (repeat the phrase, match something to a picture, etc.), there is a help screen present and the guidebook that comes with the set is also helpful.     I find Japanese is harder to learn than say Spanish or French because there's hardly any similarity to English (except when they borrow English words, like \\"juice\\" becomes \\"juisah\\")in the words or structure. I think the full immersion method is good because it forces you to use the language. I expect to have a basic knowledge after I finish with everything and to be able to converse on a very elementary level.    However, no matter what method you use, it has to be practiced frequently, with a native speaker.  Just like my friends who went to J-School back then, if you don't use it you lose it. At least my parents speak some Japanese andI know a few other people who do so I can bludgeon them with my efforts but for those who don't have someone to practice with, it makes it difficult.    I know someone who has the Korean version of this and he likes it very much (and he has a Korean wife so he gets a lot of free help!).     Overall, I rate this as a very good package for those who want to learn the language. The lessons are clear and understandable, and flow from one to the other in a sensible and logical way. I would certainly recommend it.	2008-08-21

I came into this looking for software that allowed me to do the basics, just start a song and fade it into the one before it, with some ability to control speed. Even as I read the box and all of it's features I expected that they were going to be overly complicated and not natural feeling, as I've said I had DJ'd before. Boy was I suprised. About 10 seconds after loading the program I was mixing. I went from DJ Clueless to DJ Clue in about a half hour. This thing is nice, it gives you 12 linear samples as well as looped that you can load right from your music, it has an amazingly accurate beat clock and if its wrong you can just tap in the beat, it loads the songs very quickly which was great, for example I took one MP3 and loaded it onto one table and started it and the same song on the other, started the second within four beats of the first one and played around with them for about 15 minutes. another great feature is that it has four cue points per turntabe. for example there is a break or beat in a song that you want to go back to you just tap that cue in on beat and you have just extended the song. I would not recomend trying to use this for scatching that is a very touch sensative operation, and seeing as you have to use a mouse it is a little tricky. And I also have not figured out how to cut (a demandedly two handed operation) but I'm sure I will. Let's just say I'm a fan and I only had the software for 12 hours. I may be going back for more of their software. eJay forever.	2006-12-27

That title was well earned with earlier releases, but - in my opinion - one that the software failed to live up to in more recent versions due to bugs and other glitches. Using PE 12, I can honestly say most of those bugs seem to be gone for the Windows version, and all I am seeing is a great program I enjoy using.<br /><br />So, what makes PE 12 so enjoyable to use? Simplicity and power. While the current version is not quite as user friendly as some of the earlier ones, most users will find it much easier to figure out than, say, Sony Vegas Movie Studio (my other favorite Windows video editing program). Adding special effects is easily done, and the various modes allow more experienced users to skip over guided creation when they are ready to do so. As well, PE 12 has seamlessly integrated DVD creation that will let you make professional-quality menus from templates with ease (add Photoshop Elements for the ability to completely customize these templates).<br /><br />Please note that prospective buyers should consider the Premiere/Photoshop Elements software bundle that is also available. The bundle tends to provide significant savings over the combined cost of the two programs, and Photoshop Elements can be very useful when producing videos (creating DVD menu templates, making still images for the videos, etc..).<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 Out of 5 Stars (rounded to 5). Powerful and easy to use video editing software. I can highly recommend the Windows version.	2013-11-28

Along came OneCare to the rescue with its spyware detector, firewall and a regular checkup.<br /><br />It took a very long time to load because there was so much junk on the computer, much of it needing to be deleted. But once the program was installed, the computer suddenly ran more quickly and plenty of viruses were gone, gone, gone! As noted, it maintains itself. So that is a major plus.<br /><br />Having noted that, will this be the system YOU want? Maybe - or maybe not.<br />The ability to customize this and the automatic maintenance and upgrades give us some peace of mind. They work even when our offspring is asleep, protecting the system pretty well.<br /><br />We don't like the annual fee, however. It isn't cheap! Also, some spam got by this program. Finally, it could not remove all \\"potentially harmful\\" programs. We had to do that manually and it was hit or miss for awhile, locking up the computer. In short, installation was not that simple.<br /><br />In all fairness, however, we didn't put it on the newest computer. So take that for what it is worth and consider your options.<br /><br />In summary, I would not call this the best all-purpose safeguard out there but it provides a reasonable degree of protection for those who aren't doing more than emailing or light use of the internet.	2008-03-21

While it may not have the highly advanced features of the more expensive office suites, most users - even power users - don't even know how to use those features.<br />Home Office 2000 has a fairly robust, integrated office package that is compatible with all of the major office suites.  The 2000 version is a bit dated, however, using somewhat older compatible file formats (MS Word 6, for example).  This means that there will be few issues when porting files from Home Office 2000 to another suite.  There may be some difficulty, however, opening files generated by newer professional applications depending on the complexity of the file.<br />The office suite - word processor, spreadsheet, and database - allows information to be ported from one Home Office application to another (e.g. embed spreadsheets into your documents).  The integration is fairly seamless, with glitches occurring only a little more than they would occur with the highly priced competitive products.<br />Aside from the standard office package it also bundles additional proxy server, web hosting, fax/phone, and other useful software together.  It's highly doubtful that the target market would use the rest of the software bundled in this package.  Still, it's all useful software, if a bit dated.<br />Installation was fairly painless on most Microsoft operating systems, assuming you use the default settings.  If you don't use the default setting, it may create some difficulties - especially when installing on WinNT.<br />The package is not resource intensive.  It can run on older machines (Pentium 75 recommended), and doesn't take much space on the hard drive (perhaps 100-150 MB for the office software).<br />This is an excellent general office suite that delivers a good capability for an extremely low price.  This is a very useful package that's well worth the cost.	2002-03-05

I must say I really like this program alot.  I think it is great the way I can automatically download cleared transactions from my bank accounts and most of my credit cards.  I gave this 4 stars because, for whatever reason, it will not connect to the credit card I use the most which is a retail store Master Card.  So for this card I must enter each transaction manually.  Since I had to manually enter all of my transactions on MSN Money this is not a big deal - just a bummer that I can't.  Also, there are still a few glitches that I need to figure out - I'm sure it's just me not knowing the correct way to do things like adjusting paycheck entries that automatically download from my bank account. Haven't figured out how to adjust the entries from a standard paycheck entry to one that is different - but again not a big deal.

My HP 3970 is only a year old, yet Omnipage 15 is not fully functional with the HP driver. When I checked the list, it was not on it. Do you suppose they might have made compatibility issues more explicit in their promotion? I have to scan pages of a multi-page document one at a time because the \\"Add more pages\\" button, after the first scan, does not contact the scanner; it only adds one more image of the previous page.  After a number of days of e-mail and phone calls to both HP and \\"Nuance\\" (which must mean \\"you're screwed\\", but subtly), the conclusion is that I cannot use this software to its full capacity unless I invest a considerable chunk of cash in a new scanner.  Unfortunately, I waited for 3 months before installing the program (I must have had an intuition about the troubles I'd encounter), so I can't return it for a refund.  To summarize:  Nuance says get a better driver and HP says it doesn't have one.  Forget it!	2005-11-29

I already had Adobe CS5 and Nikon NX2. For some strange reason I decided I needed Lightroom.   Unfortunately less than a duplication. It has a difficult interface and does not run very well with Windows 7 64-bit.  I thought this was simply because I was a relative newbie. Then I saw on a Nikonians website others who shared my puzzlement.  This may be an excellent program if it's all you have. Assuming you're shooting raw files I cannot understand now why anyone would need Lightroom if you already have CS5 and/or NX2.  It would probably be an excellent program if this is all you have to handle your photographic needs.	2011-11-27

I bought this product, got it home and registered, and went to open up a HD file from my collection to start work on my home movie project.  To my surprise, It had taken me to a website where I had to pay $9.99 to download the AVCHD codex which was needed to edit my HD movies.  This was a load of crap, no where on the box had it said that I had to purchase this codex.  NO WHERE!!!!!  THE package says right on the box Movie Editor Pro HD!!  It says on the back of the box that it decodes AVCHD, it does not list I need to pay $9.99 dollars for this.  I took the product back to Best-Buy and thankfully they had given my money back (in store credit) and I had bought Sony Movie Studio HD Platinum, with the money I had gotten back.  So don't get this product, it will not do what it says it will do unless you pay more money out of the box.  It is false advertising and wrong.	2011-06-17

Well the PC version can do more than the Mac version. The Mac version is crippled, and for no real reason.<br /><br />You can not network this on a Mac (PC supports 5 users, Mac just 1).<br /><br />You can not create sales orders & custom price levels (but can on the PC version).<br /><br />You can not accept credit card payments in QuickBooks.<br /><br />I looked at MYOB (you can network MYOB) and at Quickbooks. Quickbooks won only because this was for at home. I use MYOB at work ( we have 7 people access MYOB AccountEdge). The interface on QuickBooks is cleaner. The Invoice LAyout tool a breeze. The option to backup to .Mac is great (for home use)<br /><br />When the developers finally stop cutting corners and make the Mac version as feature complete as the PC version it will be a good product. If you need any of the points listed above then choose MYOB and not quickbooks.	2007-02-11

I have so many little programs, many that overlap in functions so I was cue for a clean up.  I started with loading MS Office, an anti virus program, and Acrobat.  Then I loaded emc9.  No conflicts yet.  I've used many functions and have reused them many times.  At least you can say one user has had satisfactory results in Vista. <br /> <br />There are a lot of features worth mentioning.  CinePlayer can view many types of dvds.  I know this sounds simple but I've run into several dvds that wouldn't play in other players.  If you get a blue-ray or hd dvd you can play them here.  CineMagic is the best program I've found for editing home movies.  There are several themes like b-days and vacation.  It really helps to make quick complete movie clips.  It is also easy to trim the clips and merge them.  I haven't got around to VideoWave since I find Cinemagic enough for my needs but it's there if I find I need something else.   <br /> <br />I know that photo slideshow programs are a dime a dozen but this is outstanding.  First it takes few steps to get one made.  I really like the fact that you can make edits to the photos without leaving the slideshow program.  Also in one step you can choose the save as video feature and then use Cinemagic.  In the slideshow program you can add music or do it in the video program.  There are a lot of choices. <br /> <br />	2007-05-21

I worked through the sections one at a time both to get a grasp of the many sections/steps and, after a few brief sessions of read and apply, the whole thing was running easily.<br /><br />At this point, the operation is, essentially, on automatic.

Most of the useful functions are in the Pro version only, which costs 5 times as much. After struggling for 4 hours to draw a 2D profile, when I went to extrude it, guess what? It's only available in the Pro version! Deluxe can only extrude primitive forms - circles, rectangles, arcs - but not complex curves. Useless. I am unable to make a 3D solid from my 2D sketch.<br /><br />The program could not do a decent offset on a Bezier or Spline curve. Several times I drew something and it would not show up on the screen, but then I'd save the file and re-open it and presto! there it is. Want to send directly to 3D print (which literature implies is possible)? Pro version! Want to extrude with a draft angle? Pro version. Want to extrude multiple shapes? Pro version. Slice your model? Pro version. Chamfer or fillet edges on a solid? Pro. Need I go on?<br /><br />I was VERY disappointed in this software. I know $99 is cheap for 3D design software compared with other programs out there (AutoCAD, Rhino, Solid Works, Geomagic) but from the writeup and reviews, I thought this software would at least function at a rudimentary level. It is a poor 2D drafting program and a completely useless 3D program.<br /><br />If you are interested in 2D only, Dassault has a FREE 2D CAD program that works great. It's call DraftSight and it's really excellent. Unfortunately, I have not found an affordable 3D CAD program of comparable quality.	2015-01-28

Quicken 2009's unfixable bugs are a constant annoyance. You can't turn off its re-naming feature, even though supposedly you can, and the way it works can really mess up your ability to download information from banks. It also only sometimes downloads bank deposits, and never checks them as cleared; you have to do this manually.

This is the 5th or 6th year in a row I have used TaxCut and like the previous years, I am quite pleased.     Since I used it in the prior year, all of the information I entered was carried forward to the current year to use by the software.  That makes it a lot easier.     I don't have a real complicated return.  I do itemize deductions but the most complex thing I deal with are gains and losses on sales of stocks. Even so, I HATE filling out IRS and state tax forms and HATE EVEN MORE the stupid instructions that come with them that only an idiot could have written.  So I am happy to fork over the money for TaxCut and let their much easier question interface lead me through the process, as well as let them determine if I am subject to alternative minimum tax and all these other things thrown in by slimy politicians with ulterior motives.     Several reviewers have complained about the price increase for the 2007 version and I have to agree, I am not happy either.  But considering what you pay to have someone prepare your taxes, it is still pretty reasonable. And I also find it is well worth it to let the program do my taxes instead of pulling out my hair and screaming as I try to make my way through the maze of forms and instructions that comes from the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.     To sum up: I have never had a problem with TaxCut.  The process is very clear, there is a clean data trail that you can print out, and all of the forms print out very cleanly on my printer. I intend to purchase the 2008 program next year unless we have some serious tax reform.. so in other words, I will be buying the 2008 version next year and probably each year's version thereafter.	2008-04-14

If you enjoyed the Lampoon BUY THIS!    Hopefully this will also be of help if you have technical issues with the DVD. When it arrived I popped it right into my laptop pc running windows 7. It couldn't initiate autorun and I was unable to access the disk as the laptop was unable to recognize it at all. I tried a half-dozen times but had no luck. I then put it into my 2010 Mac desktop and it showed up immediately. The autorun did not start but I could easily go directly into the DVD and access the files. I then copy/pasted them to the Mac's drive and was able to transfer them (via flash) over to the laptop. They are PDF so no problem once they were accessible.

Musicians don't want to waste time with programming.  Musicians want to create.  Cakewalk should either fix these problems or TAKE A WALK.  Do you get it Cakewalk, I was _____ with this software.  And oh, this is mild commentary, as I've had two weeks to cool off a bit.<br /><br />I sent it back to Amazon for a credit.  Thank you Amazon for your graciousness.	2012-02-29

Called company and after much discussion they sent me version 8. Did not notice any improvements from version 6 and had same problems. I was not trying to do anything spectacular, I was just recreating my existing home and trying to add an addition.I started more than a dozen plans from scratch and all the plans either locked up, would not load or would completely kick you out of the program and it would not always save the plan before crashing.  The programs does not tell you when you have made an error in design ( ie walls not meeting, etc) and if you do get an error message it will be a generic message and does not tell you where the error is.  The help line does try but they are slow and limited in knowledge- I have been trying to get a solution for my problems for 6 months.  The last conversation I had with Tech support, they told me the software was not capable of doing what I was attempting to do!!!??? I have gone back to my 8 year Broderbund Home Architect. It doesn't have all the features advertised by Individual, but at least it works.    Update 3/2006.  They sent me version 7 of Deluxe homes and landscapes about 4 months ago. It did not work and they never responded to my inquiry. Apparently they have given up and so have I. Due to the complete lack of competent support staff, I will never buy a Broderbund product again.	2005-04-10

US	36224152	R2XPZ7K58K6SCW	B007R0RKV8	349058516	Adobe Photoshop CS6	Software	5	57	71	N	N	Enormously powerful-- but do you need it?	A note: Please don't downvote this because you don't like Adobe's prices. I didn't set them, but I did spend a long time writing this to help you decide if it's worth it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />My intent here is to answer two questions: why a photographer might want Photoshop, and whether CS6 is preferable to CC. I've used Photoshop since version 4 for photography, retouching, and graphic design. Adobe has updated it ten times since. It's incredibly powerful and stable, and knowledge of it is marketable. But it's expensive and recent decisions by Adobe have complicated the value equation. I can't tell you if Photoshop is worth it, but I can describe what it'll do for you.<br /><br />DO YOU NEED IT?<br /><br />If you're a photographer, probably not. You want Lightroom.<br /><br />In the past five years, almost all of the major editing tools that photographers once used in Photoshop have migrated to Adobe Raw Converter (ACR). The ACR engine is practically an application in itself. It supports all major file types and has every color and tone control you'll ever need, as well as basic content adjustments like cloning and red-eye removal. Lightroom is ACR combined with an organizing database and batch conversion tools. It effectively replaces the former workflow, which was Adobe Bridge (a basic picture organizer), ACR (running as a separate pop-up application with batch capability), and Photoshop (for content adjustments).<br /><br />I really can't overemphasize how powerful ACR is, even with advanced functions like profiled lens corrections (e.g., CA, distortion, vignetting, perspective). If the content of the photograph is sound, there's rarely any reason to boot Photoshop.<br /><br />SO WHAT'S IT GOOD FOR?<br /><br />Quite a lot. The audience for Photoshop tends to fit into two categories: photographers, and graphic artists working in raster (pixel-based, as opposed to vector-based) formats. The typography, print, and painting engines are very powerful, as are the vector shape tools. Of greater interest to photographers are the content-adjustment tools. I'll summarize a few:<br /><br />* Clone tool - Copy one area, paste it onto another. Simple stuff. Useful to fix blemishes on an even tone or near an unwanted edge that the more powerful tools might accidentally sample. Largely superseded by the Patch tool.<br /><br />* Patch tool - Like clone, except the pasted area is blended. This and the healing brush (same thing except with a brush-engine shape and Photoshop automatically choosing the source) are the mainstay blemish-removal tools.<br /><br />* Content-aware Fill - Fills and blends the selected area with whatever Photoshop thinks should be there. It's astonishingly effective. It's replaced the clone and patch tools for large content adjustments (e.g., replacing a person or object with generic background data).<br /><br />* Content-aware Scale - Resizes a picture while keeping the proportions of important subjects. Effectively deletes or creates empty space. Useful for adapting aspect ratios.<br /><br />* Content-aware Move - A combination of the Patch tool and Content-aware Fill. Select the object, drag it elsewhere, and Photoshop blends the object into the new position and fills in the old space.<br /><br />* Vanishing Point - Cloning with perspective compensation. Expand an object (e.g., a fence or a floor) that gets larger in one direction as it gets closer to the camera.<br /><br />* Liquify - A smudge brush that works as if you were moving clay with your fingers. Every model you've ever seen was tweaked with this tool. Be fat, skinny, tall, or short. Expand the edges of your panorama. Whatever you want.<br /><br />* Puppet Warp - A more precise version of Liquify. It lets you adjust the position and shape of a particular content element without affecting the other sections. Put someone's arm at a different angle. Change the shape of a plant.<br /><br />* Dust & Scratches filter - A global adjustment filter that remvector shape tools. Of greater interest to photographers are the content-adjustment tools. I'll summarize a few:<br /><br />* Clone tool - Copy one area, paste it onto another. Simple stuff. Useful to fix blemishes on an even tone or near an unwanted edge that the more powerful tools might accidentally sample.

Put someone's arm at a different angle. Change the shape of a plant.<br /><br />* Dust & Scratches filter - A global adjustment filter that removes and blends everything of a particular size. Combined with layer blending modes and the History brush, it makes dust (or mole removal) almost instantaneous.<br /><br />* Lens Blur - A blurring filter that, when combined with effective masking, can give the impression of a short depth-of-field lens. Likewise for Iris Blur (simulates a LensBaby) and Tilt-Shift Blur (simulates the tilt function of a Tilt-Shift lens).<br /><br />These tools integrate with five other major abilities: masking, layers, actions, history, and Smart Objects.<br /><br />* Masking - Masking lets you selectively apply effects. Photoshop has powerful masking tools to isolate difficult content like hair. This ability is fundamental. Most of the adjustments in Lightroom are global.<br /><br />* Layers - Every adjustment in Photoshop can be stacked, masked, and reordered. Layers can be enabled or disabled as needed. With Lightroom, effect order is automatic and they all apply to a single layer.<br /><br />* Actions - Actions are macros that you can create or download to run an automated series of Photoshop functions. Sharpening, resizing, watermarking, border frames, and tone adjustments are common uses, occasionally all at once.<br /><br />* History - Everything you do is recorded in a history log. You can jump back to any point in time or branch a document to create a separate working copy.<br /><br />* Smart Objects - Smart objects retain all of the original layer data, so they can be losslessly manipulated (e.g., rotated, resized). Effects attach to the Smart Object and can be adjusted later.<br /><br />Most of these tools have no analogue in any other software collection. The short answer to the Photoshop question is this: if you just want to change the tone of your photos, Lightroom is plenty. If you want to change the content (more than just simple blemish or red-eye removal), there's no true alternative to Photoshop. Layers, history, basic masking, cloning, certain filters, sure, you canget that with Gimp. And maybe that's all you'll need. But for complex changes, Photoshop can make for a dramatically faster workflow and a far superior product.<br /><br />IS IT HARD?<br /><br />Not necessarily. There's definitely a learning curve for graphic and web design. It takes time to learn how best to use the type and vector engines, color management, image formats, and so on. Photographers have it easier, though not as easy as they do in Photoshop CC. The ACR filter in that one obviates almost all of the conventional tone and color controls. With CS6, you still have to learn which ones are useful and when. I relied overwhelmingly on Curves, Hue/Saturation, Vibrance, and every now and again, Shadow/Highlight. Everything else was in ACR on import.<br /><br />The other standard features (e.g., layers, adjustment masks) are consistent with other editors, though CS6's advanced masking may take some study. Because Photoshop is so popular, tens of thousands of tutorials, often in video form, exist to show you how to achieve specific goals. Most of these tutorials and the PSD files packaged with them will not adapt to Photoshop Elements, Gimp, or Paint Shop Pro. I would sooner buy an old version of Photoshop than to use any of those. The polish is obvious, and if you're going to go through the trouble of learning software this powerful, you might as well choose something you could get paid to know.<br /><br />CS6 or ELEMENTS 12?<br /><br />Elements provides a Photoshop 7ish toolset with a wide selection of one-click effects. We're missing:<br /><br />* Automation functions (HDR, contact sheets)<br />* Layer aligning and grouping<br />* Advanced color management<br />* Advanced movie support<br />* 16-bit color support (most everything requires 8-bit conversion)<br />* 64-bit code for more than 4GB of memory<br />* Smart Objects<br />* ACR advanced functions (all but basic exposure controls)<br />* Action recording<br />* Lens Correction, Liquify, Vanishing Point<br />* Every major new content tool above except Content-Aware Move<br /><br />Unlike earlier versions, if you're coming from CC, Elements 12 doesn't feel like you're working with one hand and a leg behind your back. It's a fairly capable content editor and most of the CS6 keyboard shortcuts carry over. There's also a Bridge-like organizer that runs as a separate program, an approach I prefer because it reduces clutter. It's well-implemented, intuitive, and capable of downloading Facebook names, so you can tag people from a recognizable list. (While it'll recognize that there is a face in a picture, it can't match similar faces like Facebook, so tagging is still a manual process.)<br /><br />Two changes orient Elements toward novices: first, it's JPEG-centric, and the impression starts in the organizer. The 'Instant Fix' options automatically create a JPEG copy of your original file, whether raw or JPEG. There's also no way (that I can find) to copy raw settings from one image to another. A typical pro shoot might have fifty pictures that need identical white balance correction. In Bridge and Lightroom, you fix one and paste the settings elsewhere. Here, it's one picture at a time, and the raw converter (ACR) is stripped down to bare exposure and color controls.<br /><br />But when Adobe taketh, they giveth back. Elements doesn't immediately present the standard row of confusingly-vague-unnamed-icons. Instead, you get 'Quick' and 'Guided' interface options that reduce many of the basic tools to one-dimensional sliders with clear names and previews. It's only when you switch over to 'Expert' that the standard Photoshop interface appears, along with advanced features like layers, history, and actions.<br /><br />While it doesn't have Paint Shop Pro's broader feature set, Elements is easier to use and much faster with large files despite PSP's 64-bit support. Neither program does batch processing, raw adjustments, or content-generation nearly as well as CS6. Professionals will still want the full monty.<br /><br />CS6 or CS5?<br /><br />The answer to this depends on the importance you place on speed and the functionality of ACR's tone adjustment tools. Most of the changes to CS6 are behind-the-scenes. More features are GPU-accelerated (like Liquify, which could bog on slower systems and high-res files), large blocks of text can be changed more easily, and new blur tools simplify what used to take careful layer masking.<br /><br />We also have background auto-saving, better crop and patch tools, and a more capable lighting engine. Not amazing stuff, but useful. Probably the most impressive feature is the Adaptive Wide Angle filter for correcting vertical lines and distortion in wide-angle shots.<br /><br />But really, the big change for photographers is with ACR. The entire exposure adjustment engine has been overhauled. Just about all of the tone adjustment sliders work differently. I hated the changes at first, because my default workflow was to make skin tones high-key with Fill Light, and then jack the contrast to bring the blacks down. I've since learned to adjust the midtones with Exposure and use the Black slider to fix the black point. The Shadows slider is a poor substitute for Fill Light and not that useful, but in general, I've produced better results and more accurate colors faster with the new interface. I'm a convert.<br /><br />CS6 or PAINT SHOP PRO X6?<br /><br />Paint Shop Pro could be an alternative if (a) you work with small files, and (b) they don't require content adjustments you couldn't achieve with the clone tool. The features that PSP duplicates (vectors, fonts, layers, color management, etc.) tend to be less sophisticated than CS6's equivalents, but you won't often miss the difference. Both are very powerful.<br /><br />Here's what you lose in broad strokes:<br /><br />* Smart Objects<br />* Content synthesis tools (e.g., perspective cloning, content-aware anything)<br />* Program-wide 16-bit support<br />* Speed<br />* Adobe Raw Converter and Bridge<br />* Integration with Adobe products<br />* All the perks that come with being 'the standard' (e.g., tutorials, compatibility with client files)<br /><br />If you're a photographer, ACR is a big deal. It's no small thing to do the majority of your edits in a fast and simple metadata-based tool. Nor can I discount CS6's massive speed advantage with large files. If you're designing for web or your project layers don't crest the double-digits, PSP is probably fast enough. But it wasn't much fun with my 5D II raw files.<br /><br />CS6 OR CC?<br /><br />Ordinarily this wouldn't merit discussion, but Adobe has changed the pricing scheme for Photoshop CC. With Adobe CS6 and prior, the Adobe suite and individual applications were available for permanent purchase. Buy once, use forever. Adobe CC is only available by subscription. You pay for the duration you use it, usually month to month. This has ups and downs for individual users.<br /><br />(+) Initial cost is less. CS6 is north of $600. Now you can get Photoshop for $20 a month.<br />(+) Your software is always current. When the next version of Photoshop comes out, you get it.<br />(+) Settings and content are in the cloud, so migrating to new installations takes less effort.<br /><br />(-) Long-term cost is potentially more, depending on whether you would ordinarily buy every update. If not, the break-even for this particular package is around 2.5 years.<br />(-) Multi-app packages are less flexible, so you may end up paying for apps you don't use.<br />(-) Pricing isn't necessarily fixed. Very little stops Adobe from raising rates later.<br />(-) If you stop paying, the software stops working. Given that this would probably coincide with a business downturn, you would lose access to your work at the worst possible time.<br />(-) The software has to contact the licensing server once a month. It'll work offline for 99 days. After that, you're SOL.<br /><br />That's the stick. The carrot is the collection of new features in CC. We've got a new camera shake blur reducer that I didn't find terribly effective, a radial blur tool, new resizing algorithms that don't improve much on standard Bicubic, 3D painting refinements I didn't try, a new 'Reduce Noise' slider in the Smart Sharpen box that doubles as a skin blemish remover, and the long-awaited ability (for web designers) to adjust the corner radius of a vector box shape. Not much of this blows my skirt up.<br /><br />Except for one thing: you can now apply the ACR engine as a filter. And if it's on a Smart Object, it's losslessly adjustable. That's huge. This one feature almost totally obviates the tone and color controls in Photoshop for general use, along with the separate filters for vignetting, lens correction, and so on. And because the ACR interface is far better integrated than the rest of Photoshop, it substantially lowers the learning curve.<br /><br />CS6 can apply ACR to non-raw file types, but not natively within Photoshop. You have to force the raw converter to open these files. The ACR interface presents only once on the initial opening. It's an awkward workflow and destructive because you can't make changes after import. To me, this single feature is more compelling than every new addition since Content-Aware Fill.<br /><br />ACR itself also has a few additions of note in CC: the patch tool and new perspective corrections. The patch tool is lossless and editable like everything else in ACR, unlike Photoshop's version. The perspective corrections are similar to the Adaptive Wide Angle feature that debuted in CS6. They automatically correct proportions and vertical lines. It's hard to describe, but architecture and interior photographers will love it.<br /><br />IN SUM:<br /><br />As a content editor, Photoshop CS6 is in a class by itself. CC is even better. If you need the fastest workflow, advanced content-adjustment algorithms, and integration with Adobe products, there's no substitute.<br /><br />But maybe you don't need all that. If you're a photographer, Lightroom has global adjustments (and some light content-correction like cloning and red-eye reduction) covered. Photoshop Elements 12, Paint Shop Pro, and Photoshop 7 onward do simple content-editing (and text layouts, vector art, and painting) just fine. The major adjustment with Adobe CS 8.0 and above was the progressive addition of 16-bit file support. JPEGs are 8-bit. You don't even need 16-bit for corrections that don't torture the histogram.<br /><br />Given the cost disparity, it's worth starting with a $60 copy of PSP or Elements 12. If they work for you, great. If not, you'll have to weigh whether your use scenario merits a large upfront cost or a smaller continuous dole. Adobe will let you trial Photoshop CS6 and Photoshop CC for a month. The right choice is partly a question of mindset: if each new Photoshop release has you salivating, CC is the best choice. If not, CS6 will be a better deal midway through the third year.<br /><br />Adobe actually has a free download of the entire CS2 suite with activation keys, though it's on your honor that you bought CS2. Make of that what you will.	2013-09-06

He was on it constantly till he finished it.  I was impressed.  The software makes them think through some abstract and multi-step math. He wanted me to help him (do some for him) so he could get the \\"tiles\\" and move on with the story.  I wouldn't (defeat the purpose) The game is good at \\"sucking them in\\" and motivating them to stick with it to figure it out so they can  get the \\"tiles\\" and continue the story.  He eventually figured and was very proud of himself!  It gave him confidence.  I only wish they had more than one story to go through so that once he finished it he'd have another to do. All in all, he liked it and so did I.  I think it was one more way to add some fun sharpening his skills over the summer, getting ready for 5th grade.  Or at least that is why we  got it.  Enjoy!	2008-07-29

We have a 60 yr old 1.5 story cape cod with dormers off the front and back + a 1 story addition.  I viewed the video tutorials and refered to the User's guide as I made the first story and the basement in the software and everything worked pretty well.  However, when I tried to make the complicated roof and 2nd story I ran into alot of trouble.  The auto roof build feature might work well for a standard roof, but was a real pain for me.  I viewed information in the forums and the other web resources and found alot of helpful information on dormers and Cape Cod designs, but nothing about my specific situation.    I have a help ticket in right now with their technical group and hopefully they will find a way to make my roof and 2nd story.  I don't really want to spend another $250 for the full version.    Other notes - The 3D views and walkthroughs are very cool, but don't look as good as the pictures on the box.  The landscape tools are straightforward, but I am having trouble with some items showing up in certain views.	2008-03-24

Patrons always remarked that my serene paintings and my fine art photography seemed to have a calming effect on them.  This led to the idea, back in 2006, that I might be able to use my talent to help calm down and relax people under stress.  So I purchased a reasonably good video camera, and, using my knowledge of composition and depth, I spent a year getting up before dawn and capturing (when weather permitted) several videos of sunrises over the Indian River near my home.  But, when I went to edit and produce them, Windows Movie Maker kept crashing, loosing all the work I had put into the video I had been editing.<br />I spent a ton on another video editing App, only to find that one needed a university degree to operate it; and I'm artistically, not technically inclined.  The last thing I wanted to do was become a technician (not that there's anything wrong with being a technician).<br />Sometime in 2009, I was reading the information on a PowerDirector box, and it seemed like something I could handle.  When I got home I Googled it and found I could get it $50 cheaper on Amazon.<br />When it was delivered I was surprised by the short learning curve.  It operated much like the old Windows Movie Maker; but was a lot more capable.<br />When I was done with the first video, and told PowerDirector to publish it to YouTube, I was surprised to find that one of the options was to convert it to HD.<br />I thought I'd give it a try.  It took several hours to convert and publish a fifteen minute video to HD; but the end results were so fabulous that I converted and published all 27 of my \\"Moodstosoothethesoul\\" videos to HD on YouTube.  You can see the results for yourself by going to YouTube.com/moodstosoothethesoul.<br /><br />I would highly recommend PowerDirector for novice or pro.	2013-09-29

Both Pages and Keynote are fairly intuitive applications with sleek features allow home users to produce some very nice documents and presentations.<br /><br />Both applications come with some fantastic templates, though I was disappointed not to find a large collection of user-created templates online.<br /><br />Pages, in particular, was what I was most interested in, having familiarity with--but not the budget for--both Quark Xpress and InDesign. However, I discovered a major problem with Pages that made the program so unreliable that I'm now very reluctant to use it for anything that will be shared. After producing dozens of resum&eacute;s in Pages, exporting them to PDF format, and mailing them to potential employers, I ran into a few that would require me to mail a hard copy.<br /><br />For some reason which I can no longer recall, I decided to print these resum&eacute;s at a nearby 24-hour print center. So I exported the PDFs, emailed them to the print center, and when to pick them up. Unfortunately, the printouts were a garbled mess of nonsensical characters. So I tried again, but got the same results. Surely this problem was due to the fact that the print center was printing the documents using PCs and not Macs, I thought. But when I opened the documents on my Mac using Adobe products like Reader or Illustrator--rather than Preview--I found that the problem was not limited to PCs.<br /><br />After a short time on Apple's support pages, I found others with the same problems and there was no patch or update available to fix it. I can no longer trust Pages to produce documents used by anyone other than myself and shudder to think how many of my resum&eacute;s and cover letters were disregarded when the receiving party was only able to view a mess of random characters. Shame on Apple for not releasing a fix for this known problem in iWork '06 and I can only hope that it will be taken care of in '07.<br /><br />EDIT: After reading the comment which said that the PDF problem is system-wide and not iWork specific, I've upgraded my rating to **** from **. I'd probably give it 5-stars if some reliable cross-platform export solution had been present (like a reliable PDF export).n only hope that it will be taken care of in '07.

Software	5	58	60	N	N	Great replacement for Windows 7 Card games Freecell and Solitaire	After getting my new computer with Windows 7, I loved everything about Win 7 except the versions of Solitaire (Klondike) and Freecell. The old versions from prior windows versions will not work on my Windows 7 64 bit machine. I think they tried to make the cards pretty, but mostly it is hard to look at in my and my wife's opinion. I've idled away countless hours over the years playing Freecell but the Win 7 version is nearly unplayable to me.<br />I found this Solitaire game with Freecell on Amazon and downloaded the trial version from [...]. After playing it a few times I bought it and am extremely happy. They have a free download of many card faces so one is bound to please you. The Freecell game itself is smarter and handles many of the moves automatically by using a single click of the right mouse button.<br />I haven't tried the other 723 games, but plan to try a few more.<br />If you are unpleased with the win 7 card games you might want to download the trial version and take it for a spin.	2010-01-24

I looked for a program which would keep my folders and files safe, and would also let me transfer my apps.    Luckily I found Laplink's PCMover, and chose the 'Upgrade Assistant' option in order to upgrade in the same laptop.    A downloaded .pdf file from [...] (printed out to be available during the upgrade) gave me a detailed guide (with screenshots) to the whole procedure.    As advised, first I backed up externally an image of Vista's C:\ drive. Then I installed Win7, then PCMover, and after choosing which folders,files and apps I wanted to move to Win7 or leave behind, I completed the upgrade.    Everything had been moved intact, including settings, and after installing Microsoft's updates I was able to use Win7 as my operating system. Thanks to PCMover the whole move to a new o/s (the program works for Win8 too) was achieved without stress.    If you need extra guidance/advice about the move there is a customer services chatline available 24/7 which I found extremely helpful.	2013-02-01

Yes, Canvas IS a complex program, but that dosen't make it a bad program! It is complex for one good reason...It is the best drawing/graphics program made, and it HAS to be complex to perform the incredible affects it is able  to do. Doing basic drawings and designing images is easy to do. It is only  when you come into lighting affects and transparancy features that it  becomes a little harder to use. (and then again, I STILL don't think it is  hard to use! Just harder then normal drawing) After all, for every computer  graphic I do, I use Canvas 6, and Photoshop to perform and render images.  (Look, if you have Photoshop, this program is as easy to use as it.) Canvas  is basically the same as Photoshop, only it is, as I said earlier, more for  actually drawing the images. If you like Photoshop, then you will  deffinately enjoy this program! By all means, anybody who is into graphics  and web designing should have this program. It will make designing a whole  lot easier and quicker. You won't regret getting this program! (I have yet  to find a bug on the original Canvas 6, although I must say I haven't  updated it with plug-ins. I have heard complaints that plug-ins will add  some bugs to the program, and make it a little more confusing.) Even if  Canvas 6 has been replaced by the new 7 version, it will always remain one  of my favorite programs, and in years to come, will be looked at as a  high-tech program. It's worth the price tag!	2000-06-09

Put simply, this software does not work. <br /> <br />I had my notebook pc hooked up to my new desktop (with the cable that came in the box) to transfer 18 gigabytes worth of programs and settings. When it was finally done transfering 47 hours, 6 minutes later I was so excited to go on my new PC! Soon after the computers restarted I was furious. My new computer had a totally different background and settings, none of the programs were installed correctly and I kept getting error messages. I had to do a \\"system restore\\" to undo the transfer. I ended up manually changing the settings and installing the programs and transfering my old files to my new PC over our wireless network.  <br /> <br />Do not get this product. It is an absolute waste of money and time (I threw away my whole weekend messing with this thing). It will leave your new PC with a neverending stream of error messages and hardache. The easiest way to transfer your files, programs and settings is manually, not with PCRelocator. <br /> <br />I'm now trying to send my software back.

I have been a long time user of McAfee security products.    I have installed it on many work and personal PC's over the last several years.    Recently, my home subscriptions (2 PC's) expired and I was reading a review of BitDefender.  I decided to give it a try.  It was very light on resources but I discovered it did not scan http traffic by default and kept disabling itself after updates on one of the PC's.    So, I went back to McAfee and this new version works as well as ever.  I also really like the Site Advisor Plus.  It provides lots of detailed information on sites, especially downloads and spam.    Also, McAfee is the only major security software maker that receives ICSA 2006 certification for all the components (AntiVirus, Firewall & AntiSpyware) of their security suite.    The installation is easy and straightforward.  It requires registration but this is easy and allows you to opt out of notification options.    The suite updates itself daily and gives a good balance between warnings/alerts & automatically setting permissions.    The Anti-Spam feature works extremely well and integrates seamlessly with Outlook.    I do not use the Data Backup feature as I have other more reliable means of backing up so I cannot comment on this feature.	2007-12-11

I was an enthusiastic supporter of McAfee until the last two years. They have gone the way of other vendors who hound you for money.

If I am on another person's computer, it recognizes me as their subscriber, then continually reminds me that the computer I am operating is not protected by them. It insists on renewals. In short, this program is always screaming for attention on all three machines that I paid for. Having McAfee is like working with a toothache.

Honestly, for years I have been avoiding any Norton security products like the plague.  Years and years ago I had them and just HATED all the pop-ups, they were easily the most annoying of the brands.  (I've used McAfee, Kaspersky, plenty of others).<br /><br />But I installed this one a few days ago, no annoying pop-ups or anything so far.  I really like it!  I needed something like this for my laptop since my last one expired, and this one is working well.  I haven't had any issues.  The only thing I noticed, and it might be purely coincidental, but my laptop is running a tad bit slower since installing this.  That's the reason I gave it four stars.  If that changes, I'd change my rating.<br /><br />The one other thing I thought was odd is that they ship you whole box with just a card with your product code on it.  Why do we need to be wasting paper and postage for that?  Why can't that just be emailed upon purchase?  I thought that was a bit wasteful.<br /><br />Overall I'm very impressed.  Norton has improved their product a great deal.  And if you were anti-Norton like I was, it might be time to reconsider the brand.  This product is great.	2014-10-04

To my dismay when my computer went into the shop for repairs they lost my CreataCard CD.  I was like an addict without a fix. I could not get excess to my saved Cards and I could not make new ones. Also no new product would do the same. I was lucky to find an used CreataCard and now I await for it's arrival.	2010-04-15

I called Microsoft and they told me that since I apparently did not have a validation ID included in the package, the program could not be installed.  After 15 hours of phone conversations over a period of two days with the Microsoft technicians (in India), they were able to provide me with a working validation ID and install the program.  During the process, however, they disabled my security system and firewall for a period of 24 hours.  They wanted to know where I purchased the program.  I had no telephone number or e-mail address for the seller, only a mailing address.  Also, the package was marked \\"Military Appreciation Edition.\\"  In addition, most of my defaults were deleted, I still have problems with accessing other programs, and I constantly get error messages on the screen.  I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed.	2009-05-14

You can end up spending a lot of time customizing it if you want high security.  You can allow individual sites varying degrees of access to run scrips.  It STOPS POP-UP WINDOWS cold!

This may be due the installation of an internet phone sevice, the router seemed to somehow conflict with the operating system. This however did not affect access through Windows XP running on a seperate hard drive.  <br />  OpenOffice has an impressive array of programs on a par with Microsoft Office, including a database. So many applications to choose from asside from these, all of which seem capable to stand alone in their own right. The bang for the buck ratio is far and away in favor of the consumer. Compatability with Windows aps. is somewhat dicey, but the trade-off is more than worth it for so versitile an operating system.

I just installed it on a Brand New Dell that has lots of bells and whistles and 64-bit Windows 7 premium.  I created a card and went to print it.  My printer told me (a brother HL 4040CDN) told me I needed to specify the paper in the user defined tray or something like that.  Basically, it wouldn't print.  I told it where the paper was and what to print.  I didn't have any issues printing from any other program or taking the card, saving it as a PDF and then printing it.  I googled this program and discovered that other people have had printing issues with this program.<br /><br />What good is a card creation program if you can't print with it?  You can't give it a few stars because the card sits on your computer.  Yes, you can create the PDF and then print it but you shouldn't have to.  This is especially true when you have a BRAND NEW COMPUTER!<br /><br />Nova, Broderbund....you really need to get better software development engineers.

First, I caught two translational errors and I'm a beginner, so I'm left wondering how many other errors there are that I'm not catching.  I e-mailed the company about this and all they did was send me an attachment with just those two errors corrected.  They didn't offer me my money back or even offer me so much as an apology.  I also had problems with the sound.  And I knew it was in the software and not my computer, so I e-mailed the technical department and they didn't even bother to e-mail me back.  I e-mailed the company again about the technical department not responding to me and the compnay didn't respond this time either.  And it's been about two months since I've e-mailed them.  So I would just not recommend this product.  Even without the errors, the product still isn't very good.	2002-01-21

It is constantly checking with Intuit if you are on line even if Quickbooks isn't open and downloading updates. It always wants to update your program: don't do it!

Interface looks relatively simple to use, sure there will be some learning curve, but the actual layout looks intuitive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the words \\"looks\\" and \\"seems\\" are all I can use to describe this software. After many, many attempts and two full weeks of reading Pinnacle's Knowledge base, I have yet to get it to successfully run. So I simply can't use it. I've tried everything they suggested on their help pages. Reinstall, update drivers, download latest patch, change folder names in the AppData folders, etc and I still get the \\"NGstudio Error\\" which, according to their site is a \\"general error\\".<br /><br />From their support pages they suggest you rename a folder in AppData. If that doesn't work they link you to another page that does stuff you have no doubt already tried. Reinstall, etc. So, logic says you then move to actual tech support right? Nope, you see, when you pay for this product they seem to think it's ok to then charge you again for the privilege of getting to ask them a question. That is a definite 100% turn off for me.<br /><br />This may be decent software, heck it may even be really good software, but I'll never know. I am out of ideas to get it to work, and honestly out of patience to keep trying. There are many other video editing software options out there. I'd strongly suggest looking at those instead of this.<br /><br />Thankfully this was a review copy for me and I am out no money. If I was out actual cash I'd be much more angry. This will be filed in the circular file cabinet and taken to a landfill soon.	2013-04-20

Maybe, maybe not, but it still works.	I've been a W8 user for a bit, but only on a tablet (my Surface). I just installed it on a built Digital Audio Workstation, and I'm actually pretty pumped about the implications of using DAW software with a 10-point touch monitor and W8, making it possible to emulate a mixing board virtually. I've yet to actually do that, but there are YouTube videos showing how that works, and I'm pretty pumped about it. We'll see!<br /><br />I gave the OEM install 5 stars since 1) the installation was almost completely hands-off and effortless on a built computer (yes, you can create a local account easily), 2) I personally like the new &#34;home&#34; screen layout (most whiners about it are old PC users who really don't want to change and embrace touch screen technology -- at age 64 and a keystroke-using guy, I should be in that category, so I hold optimism that others can change too!), and 3) 'cause boot up and shut down are sooooo much speedier (I will admit I loaded that benchmark a bit with 32 gigs of memory and SSD drives). Anyway, I'm not a MS lackey, but I do think that they've done a good job of moving touch screens into the workstation and laptop world, and I predict that that much more intuitive way of interacting with visual content will, eventually, eliminate the mouse as a pointer. Good riddance. It has served us, but one can't really argue that it is more intuitive than actually touching what you're pointing at. And, as a added bonus, maybe I can lose the carpal tunnel! ;-)	2014-05-01

The supplemental podcasts are annoying because they play this repetitive music in the background and there's no way to shut it off. When I'm able to tune that out, they are a nice backup, as are the audio cds. I bought all five levels, and am over halfway through the first. It's not hard to make myself sit down and do a lesson. The format is very similar across lessons, so I'm hoping some variety is introduced by the second level on. Unlike Rosetta stone, the program does not give you feedback (from what I can tell so far) about whether you are saying things correctly or not. You have to decide that for yourself by recording small chunks of yourself speaking. In spite of some drawbacks, I'm giving this program a 5-star rating because I start with whether I'm willing to get in there and engage with a program, and this one made it easy to do so.	2013-01-27

I wish I could give this product a negative star rating to offset the people who think this product is actually working.  IT'S NOT WORKING!  You don't really know if backup software is working properly until you attempt to restore.  The current biggest problem is that if your computer dies, NONE OF THE BOOT RESCUE DISKS RUN!!!  This means that all of your backups are worthless!  I created bootable rescue disks with the product directly.  None would boot on any of 3 computers I tried.  I upgraded to the latest build - same problem.  Tech support suggested downloading and ISO image - while the ISO made disks would boot and show the Acronis screen, the software would not respond.  Backup software needs to be 100% reliable.  We don't spend time and money on backups with hopes of a 50% chance of having a valid backup.  We expect 100%.  Previous versions through 2010 worked beautifully and saved my systems on many occassions.  2011 is the first upgrade i skipped since 2002, so I can not comment on version 2011 stability.  There are many other aspects of this product that could be reviewed, but none of them are worht wasting time on.  This 2012 piece of junk should be taken off the market immediately.

The primary advantage over photoshop, painter and illustrator are the french curves which allow for easy and smooth lines without having to use a time-consuming pen tool.<br />Unfortunately for me, my SBP blocked me from putting on my serial number and product key, which means it is functioning as a trial version. No one at Autodesk will help, so I'm forced to buy it a second time or go without when the trial period is over.

US	17011607	RB897VCPN38QX	B001AMHWP8	84765495	Mac OS X version 10.6.3 Snow Leopard (Mac computer with an Intel processor required)	Software	5	3	4	N	Y	Works, but install it right!!!	I am a business owner so PC has been my life since 1988. I have owned several Macs, but for home use mostly. Two Years ago I switched to Mac for my business, and have not looked back. Being a Windows user, and somewhat of a geek, it is common knowledge in geekdom to ALWAYS do a clean install with Windows. My advise is do the same with Snow Leopard. Here is how to install.    1. Back up all of your important files. If you were smart all of your files will be in your documents section thus one folder to burn to DVD. I use backup with Mobile Me, but I still burn my files to DVD when doing a new install. No need to risk losing files and jacking with back up.     2. Clean Install Snow, DO NOT UPGRADE!!!    3. After install get your updates from Apple.    4. Hit the update button again!!! Yes, I said do update again. You want to make sure you are totally updated.    5. Install software you would like to use. I use mostly Apple Software. I-Works 08, I-Life 08, Popcorn, ect,,,    6. Run update again.    7. Run update again, make sure everything is up to date.    8. Move your files from your DVD back to Documents folder, and your done.     The only werid thing I've had happen so far was with Address Book. When I restored from Mobile Me, It Moved contacts from one group to another. That did suck, I have a lot of customers. But with drag and drop it was solved in jiffy.     Being so new I have yet to master all of the new features. It is faster, I was quite suprised. Some of the new finder features were not as friendly to my \\"style\\" of filing. Example: Working with two finder windows open. One is receiving scanned documents, one is making folders, when the scanned image is loaded into finder, it switches to that finder instead of staying with the one your working in. Leopard did not do this.     Printers: The only printers I have tried are the following. Epson Multifunction, HP 5610 multifunction and Minolta 2530 Color Laser. They all worked perfectly. AGAIN INSTALL UPDATES BEFORE INSTALLING PRINTERS!!! Also check printer website for new drivers.     My favorite function. This may seem bland to some people but the new Preview is the bomb. I use my cheap HP 5610 as a fax, copier and scanner. You can take a stack of documents, load them in the HP, start Preview, scan the entire stack of documents with one click inside preview. If that was not cool enough, you can then save all of the documents together as one PDF file, or you can drag and drop each page as a single file to the desktop or where ever!!! Now that is just too cool if your a business owner and need to keep massive numbers of customers and legal documents tidy. We are going paperless, and this one feature is worth $29. This could also be cool with photos laying around before you went digital. Scan the stack of photos in random order, place folders on desktop of different events, (Birthday, Christmas, ect...), then drag each picture from Preview to the correct folder. Your old photo's organized fast.     Safari 4 was not that great on Leopard. It had all kinds of issues with certain web pages. But, to my suprise again, it works great in Leopard. Not sure why, but it does. Have not even installed Fire Fox.	2009-09-12

I would not recommend this software to anyone. It has a tendency to distort/blur pictures - both bitmap & jpeg. I have jpegs that are sharp & clear, but look absolutely terrible once this 'editor' does it's 'magic'. Whenever I'd add a crisp, clear picture as part of a longer project, the end result would be blurry...wavy. The same with text. Adding an intro 'cue card' into the project resulted in text that appeared as if termites had been at it. (Again, the actual bitmap of that same text was perfectly sharp & clear.) I've tried saving as mpegs, avi's, wmv's ...all with bad results. (And yes, I've tried different resolutions as well.) At one point it refused to play the audio of a particular track. The audio would play if I singled-out that clip, but when I embedded that same clip into a longer project - no sound. It was hit/miss with this application. Way too frustrating. If someone offers you a free copy, smack them! It gets one star because 'minus stars' is not an option on this site.	2008-02-02

This happened after I entered my product key into the TechNet site.  I do not know if this was a coincidence, but after I emailed TechNet, I was able to get this cleared up.<br /><br />While I did not have any problems using it, and while the retail price on Amazon was about $25 cheaper, I only saved $5 since I had to pay tax on the Amazon order, whereas it appears that I would _not_ have had to pay tax had I renewed online (per the renewal paperwork I received).

Once you've received your \\"Hint coins\\", you then read a letter left by Granny's attorney instructing you to call and see him. A Harry Potter Marauders' style map will instruct you on your journey (8 locations in total). Then you find clues (assorted objects/tools) that will direct you on your way to the (in my opinion, (not so) hidden treasure and the final task afterward.<br /><br />There are a few games/puzzles to be solved.<br /><br />One of them is timed and takes a lot of patience to complete, as it does get frustrating at times.<br /><br />Another is a Sling Shot wheel where you need to aim a sling shot at a spinning wheel of buttons. This one, too, can be extremely frustrating as it never stops spinning, but the simplest way to win it is to just tap each individual button until the ball taps it and changes from red to green.<br /><br />With cut scenes (while nicely done) looking like they were copied out of an old comic book or a Bazooka Joe gum wrapper and fast flashed speech bubbles, the ending of the game was really not what I was expecting ...and as that is solely my opinion, I will not say whether or not that is a good thing.	2012-08-02

Thus this qualifies as inexpensive software, and I expect no more than basic functionality.

It shows the stars, in a good approximation of relative brightness, and it shows the planets' position (not their images) with sufficient accuracy for most purposes.<br /><br />I particularly like the way the user interface allows me to click on the sky background, and drag the sky around until releasing the mouse.  Pressing F3 or F4 changes the magnification.

I started entering data for Turbo Tax Premier CD version(which for me includes a large number of entries for a rental unit.  At the end of the Federal Section all appeared OK.  I started the State portion, indicating my state.  The immediate next thing that came up was \\"Finished with State\\".  I hadn't entered anything!  My state has lots of credits and charges that alter the Federal figures, but I hadn't been asked about any.  The \\"Start State\\" box had changed to \\"Edit State\\" so I clicked on that to go through the interview.  NADA.  The program stopped there.    After some frustration I found I could print out the state forms, but the bottom line tax owed didn't look correct.    I held my breath, saved my files removed the program and reinstalled the Turbo Tax CD. Full data entry...same problem.    So I called Turbo Tax help.  After a hold of 66 minutes, I spoke with a very pleasant agent.  She had me try several things, including typing in code! After 80 minutes with her my phone went dead.  The battery died from all the hold and call time.    Next day I received a nice e-mail from Turbo Tax expressing regret the phone call wasn't completed because they had the DEFINITE fix.  First, I was to go to a specific URL then follow some of that info and proceed with other instructions they gave me.  The URL was dead - not a valid address.  I followed the rest of the instructions and re-entered the data - a third time - nothing happened, still hanging up at state.      Being a glutton for punishment I started an online chat with a Turbo Tax agent.  He explained that Turbo Tax was buggie due to a very quick update to accommodate the new Windows 7 operating system. He also said the online version was more up to date than the CD. (Of course I let Turbo Tax install updates to the CD program before starting.) After 90 minutes the agent gave up and kindly gave me a code for a free download.      So, I abandoned the CD version, uninstalling it and proceeded online - entering the data a forth time.    The program hung up in the middle of the Federal data entry.  I QUIT.      No more calls or chats.  Nothing worked.  That's why I say NEVERMORE TURBO TAX.  I purchased a competitor's program and easily completed both Federal and State forms (of course after my fifth data entry)!	2010-02-27

The electronic downloading of transactions is great, but many financial institutions do not support it due to the high cost charged by Intuit.  The most disappointing part is that there is not a built-in type for CDs -- you have to manually manage them as if they were a stock fund.	2007-05-14

I was tired of waiting for Quicken to support its Mac users.<br /><br />However, i deleted the program after a few hours due to download issues and no ability to import over a years worth of QE data.  The first thing that happened is an automatic download charge to my Wells fargo account.  I had been downloading for free for years and soon discovered the difference between direct connect and web based down loads.  I had to call wells fargo to get the charges removed.<br /><br />Once i got through that, i thought i could live with it but some of my credit cards didn't have the web connect option and i was afraid to select direct download for fear of having the same issue that i encountered with my checking and savings account.<br /><br />I also was disappointed that i couldn't convert my QE data.  there was no mention of this in the product details which touted the ability to download quicken data.  I realize this is a quicken issue, but i wish this would have been more clear in the product descriptors.<br /><br />So, will stick with QE until something better comes along	2012-12-05

Not for Desktops.	I purchased Windows 8 on the advice of a friend who was helping me build a high end gaming PC. This was in January of 2013, it is now November and drivers are just now being released which allow my system to utilize all the hardware I put into it. Up until now I have had extreme difficulty playing any of my games, even ones from several years ago such as Empire Total War. My computer was never lacking in hardware or any other area except driver support for Windows 8. Windows 8 was made as an OS for tablets, cellphones, and touch screen computers not meant to do more than browse the internet or watch netflix. If you are building a desktop for yourself, I highly advise you to avoid Windows 8. Windows 8 is not made with desktop users in mind. Stick to Windows 7.	2013-11-12

I originally bought the deluxe version, but switched to premium b/c I needed more help with ESPP and stock options.  The program is easy to use just like previous years and importing data from last year is a snap.  It also has more rental property help than the deluxe version.  I think most people will find this program along with the companion DeductionPro to be quite useful and probably all that's needed to complete their tax returns.  However, despite H&R's claims, I find the premium version to be woefully lacking in its ability to handle ESPP and stock options.  For example, after answering a few questions, the program reported that my stock dispositions were disqualifying, which I knew already.  It didn't offer any means to enter transaction details and place them into the appropriate form, in this case schedule D.  The help menu wasn't much help at all.  After a google search, I ended up on the turbotax website for details on how to enter capital gains from a disqualifying disposition.  For the price paid, I expect a complete solution!!!	2006-02-12

She can still play all the games over and over and get more rewards, but she's earned all the books she can in the program. Now she's excited to get the Jumpstart Spanish so she can learn Spanish and also the Kindergarten one to continue playing the games.

The product itself works fine during the year of purchase.  However, the real trouble begins upon trying to renew your yearly subscription via Symantec website.

Even with the patient help of my credit card provider, I was not able to get the website to accept my information.  And it leaves the consumer no reasonable option for getting support.  Therefore, I am again buying a new package via Amazon, instead of the promised efficiency of renewal support at reduced prices through the Symantec website.  This is the third time this type of situation has happened.  And it's unique to Symantec, from my experience.   As the whole value of this product is based on \\"pay higher price with initial purchase, but then pay low annual renewal fees for future years\\", the inability to renew makes this a much more expensive and much less convenient product than it initiatlly appears.

We have made use of a variety of online education systems where we have embedded videos and presentations.  I would have to say that this is not an easy tool to use.  It has a clunky interface and has fallen over a number of times in trying to import the current generation of office PowerPoint slides.    I do not know what I can say about the questionnaire module?  The whole way of working is unnaturally complicated and makes the process of undertaking a fairly simple multiple-choice questionnaire almost impossible.  You cannot weight the individual questions and then you find out that trying to do anything with the scoring of your answers is virtually impossible.    You need extra tools and extra programs for any kind of data output.My impression is that it is a complex product that pushes one into making use of multiple Adobe products when at the end of the day there will not allow a product to be independent in itself.  In order to get fairly simple educational events to happen multiple products have to be used.    If one wants to use this as a tool for an educational setting, whether that setting is as ours is a corporate health  environment where we are providing education for doctors and patients at reasonable volume this is a hellishly difficult way to go.  If you are a mega-corporate and you want a real mind blowing presentation I am still not sure that this is the way to go.  It is not a satisfactory way to take one's PowerPoint presentations into a learning environment.    Adobe has defined a particular learning environment which is much as Adobe does cobbling together a number of different products push us into the flash direction.  It is also for those people who are highly obsessional and have a very large department and want to put together a series of offerings each of which will take a monumental effort.  My suggestion for anybody who is interested in this product is to go and have a look at the tutorials on the Adobe site and it will give you a little bit of an idea about how to use this product.  In my view it is suitable for a high-end multimedia person who works in an environment that is filled with Adobe products and has their video conferencing server system, a Flash server and is producing relatively few products.  If you are in a high output area where you are producing movies, podcasts, PowerPoint presentations and are looking for a way to integrate your offering, the Adobe solution is probably very very difficult.  If you are in a corporate area with tons of resources and a full multimedia team undertaking a limited number of educational offerings this could be the product for you, but the reviews of the Adobe video conferencing integration are again not right up there.    It is my belief that if one is producing a solution that addresses e-learning I would like a simple integrated product where I can produce movies, slides and other material together and output it readily onto a variety of movie formats and onto DVDs.    In reviewing the different products in this category my suspicion is that the best is a combination of a really simple product like Camtasia with PowerPoint and some kind of reasonably simple video editing software.  In that way when can achieve 90% of what this product achieves with so much less effort grief and pain.    The most frustrating part of dealing with this program is that there is the sense that it is so incomplete.  The part that appeal to me about even trying it was the integration of the questionnaire in the system.  Adobe critically lacks its own database system that it can attach to products.  It totally paralyses the product as it cannot deal with its own output and I just do not know who put together the whole system.  It certainly is not somebody who has ever used evenbasic questionnaires in any setting.  You have plenty of freedom to change the place of your period or the size of your font but you do not have a decent reporting module.  In our area of health there is a critical need for an integrated patient education module that can include some questionnaires about their current state of health and give appropriate scoring two multiple choice questions where each option gives you a level of severity.  For example: how are you feeling today?    A.  Completely well - with a score of zero!    B.  A little bit unhealthy - with a score of one!    C.  Not very well - with a score of two!    D.  Completely ill on the verge of death - with a score of six!    There are many systems that can do these kinds of questionnaires and score them and give you appropriate answers to the extent the persons illness or disability.  There are a number of systems even in the free domain that have the capacity like Moodle.    It is my impression that this is a very limited product that cannot stand alone with some of its own function as it is currently defined.  It needs a very substantial amount of work and it needs to be a lighter version that is less focused on fiddling with trivia and can actually do the work of integrating an educational event with questioning and responses where the questionnaire is integrated within the product and actually can work properly to report.  At the end of the day, despite using a lot of Adobe products this is not going to be one that will make use of to any great degree, nor will I recommend it.    Adobe lacks a database system. It is crippled without its own with so many of its products. Its like a set of apps built around an empty core.	2010-12-15

In the past I have had very good luck with their programs, except this one. After I loaded the new Total Security I started having issues with my hardware. My Disc Title Printer does not work and hasn't since I loaded Bit Defender. I also loaded this program on my lap top and came up with the same errors and problems. I have been working with Bit Defender since I first installed this program aprox. a month ago and am still having the same issues. I am not sure that they are going to be able to fix this problem. I know it is Bit Defender that is not allowing my hardware to work as if we go into safe mode and shut Bit Defender off the Disc Title Printer works just fine until I get back out of safe mode then it will not work again. This is the reason that I have rated this product two stars.	2010-03-20

If you have any added complications like multiple income sources, deductions, farm or other taxable areas, stock loss carry-overs or have ever gotten caught by the Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT), then this program can make you life a bit easier. You may also find it handy if you are arithmetic challenged.    I find that once I have my papers collected (W2s, 1099, deduction receipts, etc) I can make a first pass through my taxes in under an hour. Doing it by hand would take hours.  I then set it aside for a while with the hope it will look better when I come back to it. It doesn't so I print out the forms (along with a copy for me) and mail it in.    Some of the features that I like and are very helpful are:  a) It remembers all your income sources, deductions, and other information form the previous year (providing that you used it the previous year) which speeds up the process and helps to prevent forgetting something (which can be worth its weight in gold by protecting against the IRS coming back in three years asking about that interest you forgot to claim).   b) It carries all the information over to your state taxes which makes that process a lot easier.   c) It handles the details of difficult things like AMT. I have never been able to figure out the AMT forms even after they were properly filled out.   d) It does all the calculations - and changes are essentially instantaneous rather than having to refill out all the forms.   e) You can file electronically although I am against having to pay to get my own money back.  f) It takes you through the process step by step.  g) It has a lot of helpful information, explanations and guidance.    On the downside is the cost. TurboTax is the most expensive of the tax programs but has been rated the best by several sources. I find that it is worth the money for me. Another annoyance is there are always updates thatyou need to download although I am not sure how many really impact the average return. I have also had problems going back to a previous years program to access the data for that year, but it may just be my problem.	2008-03-13

Photoshop, like so many other Adobe products, seems to speak a language all its own.  When Joe created the finished product, he gave it to me to review.  So here we are!<br /><br />The Introduction begins with a menu that allows you to hop around from topic to topic.  I started with the Introduction.  Joe introduces himself, talks about the product, and thanks you for purchasing \\"So You Wanna Learn Photoshop.\\"  I call this the \\"airline approach\\"-I think every company should thank you after you purchase something from them. The only thing that's missing is a picture of Joe...since he's addressing me, I would have liked a picture of him or something.  Instead, we stare at the image of the Eyeballistic logo.  Neat logo, but I couldn't help but feel that Hal was talking to me.  That eye...I think it's mad at me...<br /><br />Basically, Joe takes you step by step through everything you see on a Photoshop screen. The mouse moves where Joe directs it, acting as a sort of on-screen actor.  Most of the concepts are straightforward, but they are all presented with the expertise of a tech writer.  I should know, I was a tech writer.  Tech writing can be a soul-grinding job, but it requires impeccable accuracy and consistency in approach.  Joe pulls it off with ease.<br /><br />To Joe's credit, his voice is measured, with no stuttering or mistakes.  The audio isn't fantastic (it sounds like there's a fan in the background sometimes), but he's audible and understandable. He enunciates clearly and slowly. If you miss something, you can pause, forward, or rewind the narrative with a bar at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Since I don't have the latest version of Photoshop, some of the instructions didn't apply to me.  Other parts I knew already (I know all about clicking, shortcuts, resizing windows, etc.). There are over 80 tutorials in total. I skipped to two topics I really wanted to learn about: the heal tool and color replacement.  Both of the tutorials answered my questions and made me really want to get Photoshop 7.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent series for folks who are more visual and need to get up to speed quickly on Photoshop without time to read those massive 400+ page tomes.  A must have for any budding Photoshop artist.ver 80 tutorials in total. I skipped to two topics I really wanted to learn about: the heal tool and color replacement.

Some divisi, and some out of synch entrances between first and seconds in same part. I kept the manual close by, and referred to online help a couple of times, but it printed out 7 pages of professional looking music.<br />The only glitch was that playback didn't play first and second endings properly. I didn't have time to do the research because I had to collate and staple. I'll figure out what I did wrong on the next p[project. The first and second endings on the print copy looked fine, just that playback didn't like the way I entered the notes.<br />I didn't take time to learn how to use keyboard shortcuts.

Apart from some very short outages, it worked fine and proved to be a good and useful service.   The migration of the .mac service to MobileMe was quite exciting. The extra functionalities sounded very good, and I was looking forward to try them out. Unfortunately, and further to a bit of a rocky start - perhaps not surprising, given the complexity of the update - unspecified problems occured to one of their servers causing 1% of their users (20,000+ people?) to lose access to their email.   This situation has been going on for over 7 days now. Those affected (me included) have not heard a word from Apple, apart from a paltry two sentence acknowledgement of the problem in their support pages. We have no updates, no help from their support staff, no idea when the service might get back up, and no reassurance that our email on the server is safe.   All in all this situation has been managed in an appalling manner, and Apple should be ashamed.   Until they can guarantee that this will not happen to you, stay away from MobileMe.	2008-07-25

However, the book does not clearly define what order one should create a the business plan.  For instance, one od the first chapters describes the table of contents, and then towards to end of the chapter tells you not to do it until last...next is a chapter about the executive summary, and then towards the end of the chapter it says one cannot do it until you have done everything else.  O.K. Ms. Pinson, what order do you recommend one create a business plan?  Your book says 'step by step', but fails miserably at describing the order of steps.  Another shortcoming is the lack of examples...only a few examples for each topic.  I would think that w/ software, the author would load up w/ examples....which is not the case.  The software and book for defintion purposes is excellent.  In terms of describing the priority of business plan steps (i.e. what to do first, then second, etc.) the book/software is a failure.  In terms of providing abundant examples I would rate the book/software as a \\"C-\\".	2006-12-05

I've decided to give it a 3 star review because, frankly, I had to keep googling youtube videos to figure out how to do things that should be very easy to do.  Once you figure out how to do it, then you realize how powerful the editor is.<br /><br />This year I've created projects with Cyberlink PowerDirector and iMovie.  Not surprisingly, when you just want to quickly put together some clips to post to facebook, iMovie wins.  Next up, I like power director, but it is only slight ahead of Pinnacle Studio.<br /><br />One really nice thing is that it has a lot of built in transitions and effects.  I found the export menu to be one of the easier menus I've used.<br /><br />I liked the clip editor screen quite a bit (after I youtubed a tutorial).  However, I used color and brightness correction on a snow video (sledding) and the final result didn't look very good.  It really struggled to properly correct the snow.<br /><br />One thing I really didn't like is that the effects / transitions labeled &#34;GPU&#34; wouldn't preview render for me at all.  This is very annoying, especially since I have a Radeon r9 270x GPU.  I also pulled up the GPU monitor when doing export and as far as I could tell it never even used the GPU.  I do have an i4770 CPU, which it pegged at 100%. So, as far as I can tell from reading the documentation, you have to have a Nvidia GPU or you will not get any advantage from your GPU.<br /><br />All in all, this product didn't leave me especially unhappy with it or very excited about it. In other words, I don't see much of anything that makes it stand out as an obvious winner.	2015-01-01

(I still help family and friends.) None of the System Utility Suites are perfect, but after years of trying just about everything on the market, System Mechanic Pro has a low price and has been the best and most reliable I have used. I have been using System Mechanic Pro and installing it on peoples computers for about 7 years. I have never had any of the problems like the ones in the other reviews. It has so many features for the money that most people wouldn't now how to use them. You can install it on 3 home computers for the same price! I personally highly recommend System Mechanic Pro, but every person is going to have different opinions and likes. However, I recommend that you use Norton Antivirus or a top free one instead of the one included. Just install it without antivirus. Utility Suites functionality also depend your computer and what you have installed. You need to make sure they are compatible with (software, hardware, etc.) everything on your system. Norton Utilities (System Suite etc.) used to be the best, but it seems that for the past 7 years it is missing features, has a complicated installation process, memory hog, runs slow, poor navigation. The suite does include a lot of features and several tools, but is the most expensive of all I've tried. There are a couple of other really good suites, but I have had great success with System Mechanic Pro.	2013-08-28

XP would get four stars from me, if it weren't for the Activation Code issue. I didn't think Product Activation was bad until I read the fine print. I get 30 days. That's for the life of the product. If you use 20 days at the start, and in six months you add some hardware, you now only have ten days left (The clock does not restart). Once the 30 days is used XP is disabled every time three things are changed on the computer. Extra RAM and a new processor (counts as two) and I need a new code. I don't think this is going to help the piracy issue, but it looks like it will be a big pain for the rest of us. Stick with Win98 or ME.	2001-10-29

This product does not work well on a Mac, which is the preferred platform for graphic artists so that was very disappointing.  The quality of the scans and recognition is terrible and I finally stopped using that function and started entering music directly.  Takes no more time and is far more accurate although as a music notation program SmartScore falls well short of others on the market.  The functions are not intuitive and many music notation symbols and functions are missing or too cumbersome to use,  To make matters worse the instructions are poorly organized and not at all use friendly.

The process was easy and I experienced no problems with drivers.  I've been running for a couple of months now and I find the two most annoying facets of W8 are the missing Start button and the inability to close applications. Much has been written about the need for MS to bring back the Start button and I agree with them. I would add that MS needs to bring back the close/exit button. I find that it feels wrong to leave applications running when no longer needed. I read that W8 closes them automatically when the resources are needed elsewhere but it is feels wrong to leave it the operating system. I know others who have installed the start button fix but I'm making a strong effort to work within the new Metro interface. It is clearly designed for tablet operations but, for desktop computers, it is more cumbersome than W7. I hope MS will bring back the buttons for desktop computers in Windows Blue.	2013-04-28

S&T has an extensive POI database that is considerably better than I have seen in an in-car system.  I did, though, encounter entries that were years out of date.  The altitude readings were very nice in the mountains.  And it is quite fast. <br /> <br />Bought this for a family trip from Minnesota to Colorado.  My main needs were ones that I *thought* were pretty basic:  (1) \\"I'm hungry!\\"  What are our food options coming up?  We need food that is at least a notch up from Subway, which can be very rare in Nebraska.  (2) \\"I gotta go to the bathroom!\\"  Sometimes we would prefer a rest area, sometimes a gas station, and occasionally any place with anything resembling a toilet.  (3) \\"When are we stopping for the night?\\"  What are our hotel/motel options ahead? <br /> <br />In all cases, I want places that are AHEAD ALONG MY ROUTE.  I really don't want to know about the perfect place behind us, or far off our route.   <br /> <br />S&T has a search feature that is pretty much worthless.  You can search within a radius of your current location, but all directions are NOT equal for me when I am trying to get someplace.  You can search along your route, but then it returns any place along the ENTIRE ROUTE, and sorts them by distance to the route.  Also useless.  <br /> <br />I also got a bit frustrated when I was dutifully following its directions seeking a restaurant in Omaha and suddenly got an OFF ROUTE message, which left me with no idea of what to do next.  It does not seem to re-route, which really surprised me. <br /> <br />The thing has great potential but IMHO is not ready for serious in-car use.	2006-09-09

For years, I have been watching designers, with the flip of their laptops, create curb appeal, take on landscaping challenges, and transform the inside of outdated homes into beautiful spaces.  Now, with this software, I see how they do it, and better yet, how I can become my own designer.  I can even design a house from scratch if I want to.  The software was easy to install and I found it easy to get started after watching the tutorials.  There is also a very comprehensive manual that I can refer to.    The amount of information contained in this little box is incredible.  My main interest in the package was the landscaping.  I want to redo the front of my home, build a deck off the dining room and figure out what to do with my big empty back yard.  I can definitely do all of that and more with this package.  There are so many choices in the various libraries (sidewalks, driveways, fences, walls, and even patio furniture) that I can click and drag in place.   There is a deck wizard that will make designing my deck easy.  I really like the plant encyclopedia with over 7,500 click and drag choices that will allow me to pick the perfect shrubs, flowers, and trees for my climate.  I can't wait to get started.      But, that is just part of what is contained in this suite.  I can decorate, remodel and build a house.  There are 10,000 home plans to choose from if I don't want to design from scratch.    To complete the design, I can choose from a huge catalog of cabinets, appliances, electronics, doors, windows, right down to HVAC options.  Just click and drag them to visualize the space.  I have a few remodel projects in the future, and this part of the program will be perfect for me to visualize what I can do in my space.  There is a large catalog of paint colors to play with after downloading pictures of the outside or inside of my home.  It was fun to see how changing the color of the house, trim and dooron the sample house can make such a difference.  There is even a video disc with over 30 how-to-tips that I can't wait to watch.      I know I will be having fun with this versatile package for years to come.  Thanks HGTV!

The software is very difficult to navigate.  It thrusts you right into a choppy video which is neither interesting or easy to follow.  They apparently copied the video (with permission of course) from some other video training program and give a full paragraph of attribution to it on the right side of the software.  Do we really need to know this?    I tried to use this program but it is too open-ended - no way to really measure progress.  I just don't see how filling in crossword puzzles is supposed to help learn, along with the other gimmicks.  I would be very surprised if anyone actually learned Spanish using this system, let alone have the patience to work with it for even 15 minutes per day on a consistent basis.    I plan to get the Fluenz Spanish system as that one got great reviews.  It's pricey but you get what you pay for and from the reviews sounds like exactly what I would want to learn with.  I also have the \\"Instant Immersion\\" CDs for playing in the car which are very good.  However, a more complete program is needed for learning Spanish and so that is why I am looking at the Fluenz.	2008-12-26

I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.    I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.    Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.    XP is pretty good. I use that at work everyday. I bought a laptop with Vista. That sucked soooooo bad that I ditched Vista completely and installed Ubuntu. I've had no problems with Ubuntu. I'm going to upgrade to Ubuntu on my desktop(the one with Windows 7 on it now). I will also never be purchasing another Microsoft product, hardware or software. I can't financially support a company that charges for such crappy products.     Ubuntu and Firefox are where it's at.	2010-01-23

It basically will load up every picture in your chosen file. Thats swell, however when you go to edit, say photo #220...and you go back to the organizer, it bumps you back to the first picture. It does not remember where you were last looking, and it just adds an extra annoying step of weeding your way back to photo 221 and so on.<br /><br />The next issue is... the trial version. DO NOT INSTALL IT.<br /><br />I installed it by accident on my PC at work, and then went to delete it. I thought it was gone.<br /><br />A few weeks later I re-installed Corels purchased version. I could not install it because apparently the trial version was still somewhere leeching on. Without removing it fully there was no way I could install my paid version. WHAT A DISGUSTING LET DOWN!<br /><br />I found these ridiculous instructions to uninstall the program online and on Corels forums. I could not get those instructions to work either.<br /><br />But how gross that they leave people with a set of instructions like this just to remove a trial, instructions mind you, that do NOT work. It should not be this difficult to remove a trial version.<br /><br />I used to be a fan of corel, and would continue to be had their trials not invaded my machine. I cannot even use it on my work pc now, as I have tried everything to remove the trial with no success. What a disgusting company.<br /><br />I will never ever again buy Corel, and would highly appreciate it if someone could point me in a new direction for photo editing software, as Corel has lost my business.	2012-06-21

This program fits into that niche.  It utilizes the basic skills I already possess, and challenges me to learn more.  It IS a resource hungry program, but just about every video editing program seems to be that also.  I was able to quickly capture clips, assemble them into a short video with titles, and the result looks pretty good.  I have much more to try, but so far I am happy with the money spent.  One feature I looked for in particular was the ability to recognize MPEG-4 video.  Most true beginner programs, even the new ones, could not do this, and it is the format of choice on my Sony camera.  Titling was fairly simple, but I think some of the Adobe conventions carried over for me from my experience with Photoshop.  Install worked the first time, but follow the directions carefully and make sure you turn off programs it tells you to disable.  It is NOT a QUICK install.  I would say that this is not, nor is it intended to be, a program for those who want high-end, professional video results.  But for movies of my grandchildren, it's working out well.  Take the time to have some fun with it.  If you are NOT a Photoshop user, you might want to try Photoshop Elements as a companion product.	2009-09-30

Had i known that, i would not have PURCHASED IT! I was extremely disappointed with their lack of attention to detail, you would think something like that would not go unnoticed.   Despite this, I still desperately wanted to try the software, so I tried using a trial version of it on my PC at work - which meets ALL the specs, however only has 8GB of memory, the minimum recommended by onOne. Nevertheless, it runs, but constantly crashes and the lag time is ridiculous. I run Photoshop CS5, Lightroom, and Bridge (sometimes all at once) on this computer and I've hardly EVER encountered a force quit, or crash like I have with this program. It uses up a LOT of memory, or it is just seriously buggy. Either way, try before you buy, and on the computer you will use to run the software!	2011-12-27

Only a handful of times I've had the program shut down in the middle of a project. <br />  I only wish that the the units were much easier converted to inches(down to the 1/4\\") The larger the sceen the longer it takes to render and saving people takes forever. <br />  Ove all... lots of fun and have taught teenagers to use it in an hour. <br />Best, <br />MIke	2007-05-22

Currently, I'm crosschecking it with data directly downloaded and compared with my banks, credit cards and accounts. The damage: Trust in the program. I'm spending time double checking and verifying data that for the last 10 years I have confidently downloaded and depended upon. I would suggest that you more prominently display the menu for repairing damaged files.<br />Another thing: It has taken me years to learn to extract data for budgeting, filing taxes, etc. It does not help to have the procedures \\"gerrymandered\\" beyond recognition.	2014-01-11

Using motion tracking you can actually put a person's name near them and have it follow them around on screen.  Don't get me wrong, unless you are at least a semi-professional film editor there will be a pretty steep learning curve to tackle if you ever want to take advantage of the full potential of all this has to offer.  But it's just so much fun, and impressive when you do a good job and put it on your iPad to show off.  The only problem I have noticed is that it seems to need a more powerful computer than my two year old Alienware desktop, which I thought was still pretty cutting edge.  I have problems playing HD 1080p files without freeze ups and slow down.  I guess 4k is out of the question unless you have a extremely fast computer with lots of memory.  I have always enjoyed Corel products, ever since the early original Corel Draw days, and I've never been disappointed in any Corel product I have purchased, and this is certainly no exception.  While I probably will never use this to its full potential I am happy to be able to do more if I really want to.  If you have enough interest to be reading this then I can tell you honestly, get it and you will be glad you did.  Anyone who finds fault with this product is really digging.	2013-05-17

For the price, I feel that the program is well worth it. There are many graphic and musical options. One drawback is that your first PhotoShow must be \\"burned\\" from the Nero website. I assume they added this feature to protect their software copyrights. After burning your first one on the web, you are able to burn from your computer at will with their automatic free download. I've read from reviews that you can't place newly added photos where you wish. It is a simple drag and drop option. If you want to place a new photo to the left of one in your show order, drag and drop when a red bar appears to the left of the desired photo. If you want it to the right, a red vertical bar appears to the right. Again, for the price, I am very happy with the software. I plan on producing many family PhotoShows in the future.	2007-01-04

The IT guys tried to give me Visio, but it's too complicated.  The latest version, 2008, has great new stuff and fixed some problems.  All I can say is that my presentations blow away anything the exec team has seen.      They added the 'ribbon' interface just like Office 2007.  It takes some getting used to, but once you learn where every command is, it is much better.  If you're new to SmartDraw, then it will just be that much easier to start using.    Version 2008 has charts that let you do a lot more than Excel.  You can put multiple charts in a graphic, with text, arrows, images, whatever, before exporting to PowerPoint.  Much easier to make a good slide rather than klunky excel-powerpoint stuff.	2007-12-05

I've used Photoshop for a couple of years now and am pretty much self taught on how to use it (mostly for photo manipulation) and have been looking for a tool that will artificially paint a photo to give it a painted look without actually having to paint the picture, which is what initially drew me to Painter Essentials.<br /><br />I've played around with it a bit and found that some aspects are quick and easy to learn, but others I could use a tutorial or a book to refer to to get the best results.  And that is where I have my biggest complaint.  Not all of it is an intuitive as I would like and unfortunately there aren't as many online resources to refer to for help as you find with Photoshop.  I looked on Amazon and I couldn't find any tutorial books (like Painter for Dummies) to purchase in regards to this program which was really disappointing.  Overall, I like it and could possibly learn to love it once I know how to really use it.	2015-04-03

If you are looking for an exact replacement of Photoshop, this isn't it. However, it has most of the features that non-professionals want and need for graphics editing in addition to a lot of features that few people will ever use. Paint Shop Pro is not the most intuitive program on earth, but I have yet to see any powerful graphics editing software that is. It certainly is easier to learn than Photoshop and costs hundreds of dollars less. It is even a greater bargain if you buy it bundled in the Corel Photo Video Suite X6.<br /><br />The Corel Video Suite is a great video editing package that seems aimed at the home/hobbyist user. It may not be as powerful as some of the very expensive professional video editing software on the market, but it fills a niche that many of us fall into. The one caveat I will mention here is that you really need a powerful computer with great graphics to get the most out of this program. There are very few (if any) laptop computers that would fall into this category. I would recommend a minimum quad core CPU with 12 GB of RAM and a very recent graphics card with at least 2GB of onboard memory. For hard drive usage, a SSD or minimum 7200 RPM drive should work, although for large amounts of storage and speed I would recommend using a combination of a SSD for the operating system files and a secondary RAID array for long-term storage of working video files. This app is CPU, memory and graphics intensive, as one would expect with any software of this type. The results though can turn home movies into professional-looking short films and has too many features to even begin to mention.<br /><br />On the whole, the bundled software is not only a great value, but a great product for getting professional-looking graphics and video edited on a home PC. My install was on a copy of Windows 7, which I had no problems with. Keep in mind, if you choose the 64-bit install to take full advantage of your hardware's speed, there will still be a number of 32 bit drivers installed. As long as you have an adequate amount of disk space, this shouldn't be a problem though. It's partly the inclusion of both sets of drivers and other files that allow the program to run as stable as it does. Compared to most software running on Windows, especially ones that use up a LOT of resources, the Corel Photo Video Suite X6 is an extremely stable and mature product. With all of the free and demo software being produced these days, this is one of the few that I don't feel cheated spending money on.<br /><br />About the only downside I feel worth mentioning with this product is the lack of physical documentation (i.e. a manual) or extensive online support that is available with some other products (especially Photoshop). Although Corel offers paid support for some of its products, it is usually much easier finding solutions to problems by searching for them online. Since this software suite does not have nearly the number of users that Photoshop has, nor the online support facilities of a company like Adobe, it may be more difficult to find answers to your questions than one would like. This would be a major sticking point if it were aimed at professional graphics artists or video producers, but that's not the market niche that Corel is aiming for, which is one of the things that makes this graphics/video suite as affordable as it is. All in all, I'd say that the support issue is worth docking the product a single star, but it is still easily a 4 Star product and well worth the money.p in mind, if you choose the 64-bit install to take full advantage of your hardware's speed, there will still be a number of 32 bit drivers installed.

My PC was freezing due to some file errors, but chkdsk/f would not correct the problems because windows saw the the drive as \\"RAW,\\" which supposedly means the drive is unformatted.  Usually, the files on  a RAW drive would not even be accessible, but in my case they were.     I figured that the Norton Disk Doctor component of this package would take care of the problem in short order, but instead, the worthless piece of crap software would \\"complete\\" the diagnostics in about 5 seconds (including the surface scan) and reported that the drive had NO PROBLEMS! Windows chkdsk was able to list the actual errors in the file structure, so I knew that they were present. After screwing around with this worthless dog of a program for a while, I finally had to back-up the files to an external drive, repartition and format the problem drive, then load the files back onto it.     Complete success, all symptoms fixed. But no thanks to Norton's worthless, ineffective product that is supposed to fix simple disk errors without having to blow away the partition and restore the data. By the way, after manually fixing the problem, NDD runs on the drive for about 20 minutes before it announces that it is healthy. When the file structure was broken, it  only  took 5 seconds before it lied like a dog. Very disappointing; Norton Disk Doctor does not live up to its hype.	2009-01-21

Be sure to purchase this edition, it's $4 or $5 more but has a lot more features.  For me the learning curve is steep, but with persistence I hope to overcome my lack of innate talent.  It's less than $40, even if I should find the program a bit daunting and give up I won't have broken the bank in the process.

And, it really helped us find some really nice restaurants and some great entertainment vendors.<br /><br />Had we not had our Garmin with us and this Costa Rica map installed, I know that we would have spent many lost hours recovering from wrong turns and stopping to ask for directions.<br /><br />So, this really enhanced our trip and made it that much better.<br /><br />Bravo !!!	2012-06-20

I love Windows 7.  My computer got a virus and I had to re-install Windows 7.  I lost my product key on my original Windows so I had to purchase this copy of Windows 7.  I do not care for Windows 8 which is why I purchased Windows 7.  My only complaint, which is a pretty big complaint is that it is missing the boot image file.  I have been assembling computers for a long time now and I know how to do a clean install.  Without boot image file you are unable to boot from this disk and install this copy of widows.  What I had to do was install my other copy of Windows 7 that I no longer have the product key for then once this older copy of windows was installed then I could install this copy of Windows.  Once this copy of Windows was installed then I could just delete the older copy of windows that I had to install to install this copy.  What I'm going to do is to make a boot image file for Windows 7 and then copy this disk on a new disk along with the boot image file so if I ever have to re-install Windows 7 I can do it threw booting my computer.	2015-03-15

I've learned a little german through Rosetta Stone german for dummies, and wanted to be able to become atleast proficient in german. With all the praise this product got i thought it would be incredibly good. However when i started using this program it would start u off with vocabulary that you've never learned and when you use the translation key it gives you five or so translations for each word, making it even more confusing, and then you would get crossword puzzles that included tons of words that the program hasn't even taught you yet, so i would try to look them up, but many times i would not be able to find the right word to fit the number of spaces, and even if i did, i would rarely remember what the word was. Then there were these exercises where you would have to type what the speaker was saying down: first they spoke way too quickly for somebody learning the language, and second, if u had one little tiny mistake in how you typed the sentence (you forgot to capatalize a letter, forgot the period, spelt a word a tiny bit wrong) it would mark the ENTIRE sentence wrong, they also used many words that you've never learned yet, and i don't get how hearing words that you don't know is going to help. Also if you were trying to find any words in the dictionary you would have wait a minute or two for it to load and then search for your word, and then go back to your excersize that you would now have to start all over again. Plus it would also give you grammar excercises on grammar its never taught you. The entire program never really teaches you anything unless you spend a long time trying to find what you want in the grammar excercises and memorize them and memorize the dictionary which is a complete pain. I was frustrated so much by this program that i emailed the company to ask where it teaches you the vocabulary, and she just said it teaches you as you go along, which doesn't happen at all.       Inshort, save your money even a simple book like Barron's Learn German the fast and fun way for $18 is much more effective at teaching you german then tell me more german.	2007-12-31

In comparison to Dreamweaver 3.0 the big advantage of MX is the way in which the  design area and code windows can be organized. My favorite - for a single monitor - is to have the code and design areas split horizontally so that clicking anywhere on the design area directs you to the same location within the code. This makes finding where you are on a busy page so much easier. The Ctrl + Shift + I key combination is handy for hiding named anchors, etc, to quickly get a more browser-like look. And the extension manager is very welcome, so that you can add extra extension files, such as PayPal's Add To Cart buttons.<br />The only downside to MX is the computer horsepower it needs to get launched. DW 3.0 will run on anything in excess of a P100. MX needs something in excess of A P500.<br />In comparison to Dreamweaver 4.0 there's not a lot of obvious benefit, unless you're doing a lot of monster web site design, and want the integration with the rest of the Macromedia MX suite of products. Using MX in the MX mode does require - in my experience -  the use of dual displays so that the MX panels can be un-docked and set up in their own monitor area. This would require a graphics card such as a Matrox G550, which can run two monitors independently. This way of working with MX makes for a maximized Window design area. This also applies to any of the Dreamweaver options, in which even having the property inspector open is intrusive clutter.	2002-11-28

But it was on sale, it had some good reviews, so I thought I would give it a try. The very first thing I noticed is the new start screen is not needed. The second thing I noticed is that the start screen was put in place as part of a money grab on MS's part. They are not able to sell their phones or tablets, so they are trying to force their &#34;apps store&#34; on computer owners. The desktop does not have a start button, because MS wants you to go to the start page in hopes you will start buying from their app store.<br /><br />The big question everyone has, is this an upgrade. well, its not faster, the people claiming it is, are just using the MS native asp's on the start page. But, if you want to open something like, photoshop, outlook, notepad or any other program installed on your computer, what happens is the &#34;tile&#34; on the start page first opens the desptop then will open the program...very clunky in my opinion. The good news is there are third party programs you can get for free and for pay, to add a start button to your desktop.<br /><br />pro's<br />networking is better<br />probably some under the hood improvements (which could have been added into win 7)<br /><br />cons<br />its a money grab to try and make money off their app's and to promote people to buy their tablets/phones.<br />its not faster<br /><br />is it worth it...for 39-49$ yes, but not for the  full price MS is wanting to charge. You would have to be a sucker to buy this for 100$<br /><br />what can MS do to make it better, give the option of disabling the start screen and putting a start button on the desktop where it belongs. Will they do it..no...it would then defeat the purpose of making win 8 which was to get you to buy their weak app's.	2012-12-21

Ok where to begin with Microsoft's newest P.O.S.? I had the chance to start running Microsoft Windows Me a few months ago, and I jumped at the shot. I was really happy to finally get a new OS on my machine. <br />   Let me begin by letting everyone know what I am running now. I have a custom built machine, by myself. It is a Cerleron 566 overclocked to 850Mhz on an Abit Rev.II motherboard, 128mb RAM, 100 gigs of Hard drive space, Road Runner cable (not so) high speed internet access, Turtle Beach: Santa Cruz soundcard and a Matrox G200 Mystique 8mb video card.<br />   Ok I'll put it this way, Microsoft's Windows ME does not let me use my computer to its best of performance capabilites. Win Me is slow and it looks like a direct rip off of Windows 2000. Well not that, that is a bad thing, Win 2k is at least a stable operating system that is powerful (to say the least). <br />   Windows ME just runs about as fast as a turtle, and it is system resource hungry. I constantly have to restart whenever I do any multitasking. When there are multiple web browsers open, you can kiss half of your resources good bye. I have a lot of .dll (dynamic library link) failures when I multitask and my system just runs terrible. Once most of your memory is used up, if you dont restart... Then your internet speed will cut in half and folders take their time to open. I was also not a big fan with the networking capabilities on WIN ME. It almost looks as if Microsoft took Windows 98 ripped out have of the networking abilities and then threw WIN 2k icons on top of it, therefor creating Windows ME. <br />   To put it nicely, I am really dissapointed with this OS. I was overall impressed with Windows 98 Second Edition and I still prefer it now. But to tell you the truth, I was really excited when I heard Microsoft was releasing WIN ME. I had a lot of high hopes that were really let down. I dont even know what went wrong, but Microsoft really screwed this one up!<br />   I hate WIN Me and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. But, I will let you know that there are a few good points to it and I can see how others might enjoy it. WIN ME is very easy to navigate and very user friendly. There are a bunch of new options in Windows Media Player, which I'm sure a lot of people will like (although, I dislike Media Player myself). The overall appearence to Millenium is nicer. I really enjoy the look of it, as opposed to the old 98 and 95 series. What do I mean by that? I mean the desktop and menues. It is set up a bit nicer and the new icons look more upbeat. Although they are nothing new, everything came from Windows 2000. Oh yeah, try and restart in MS DOS Mode, you can't... Because it's not there! Microsoft decided to leave DOS out of WIN ME, except for the DOS prompt inside Windows. But overall, there is just nothing in Win Me to keep me running it. It took me a month or so to make my decision to go back to WIN 98 SE on a dual boot with Mandrake Linux 7.1<br />   My recomendations are to either stick with Windows 98 Second Edition or with Windows 2000. If you are looking for a fast OS with stability, it is best to stay away from Win ME. If you have it in ya, learn Linux... Linux is fast, powerful, stable and fun once you get into it. But do your self a favor, stay away from Microsofts newest operating system Windows ME - Millenium Edition, or try it out first to decide for yourself. I didn't care for it in the least bit. I would give it 1 star, but I know it doesn't really deserve that. Hey, at least it runs... Thats about all I could ask from it. But the truth is, WIN ME just plain sucks. There isn't much to it that I like, I would probably never go back to it and most of my friends feel the same way. Actually, just about everyone I have talked to, who hava ran Windows ME disliked it. Read what other people have wrote. Most of them dislike it too! Honestly, I'd stay away!<br />   I hope I gave some of you a bit of information that is useful. I'm not trying to bashMicrosoft because they are the industry standard, because I'm not. I just wanted to provide you all with my point of view about the way I feel and my experiences with their new program. I am awaiting the next version of WIN ME (whatever they'll call it). I'd be more than happy to run it too. Plain and simple; I didn't care for WIN ME and I wanted everyone to know where I stand =) Hope that did it for ya! And if you really want to, try it at risk!	2000-09-26

But for the last 2-3 months I started having problem with my CD-RW/DVD-RW burner(This drive came installed on my &quot;Dell&quot; computer when I purchased it 14 months ago along with Roxio basic edition 5). <br /> Once a CD-R/RW is inserted into the drive Roxio 6 alerts you that this disc in not prepared and formatted, so you can not use it.Therefore you have to format it using the &quot;Format Disc&quot; option, a process wich takes 25-45 minutes. Only thenafter is the disc ready to use (i.e. saving files on it) just as a floppy disc(i.e. you cane erase a single or multiple file(s) witout the need to erase the whole disc completely).As I mentioned all the features(e.g saving ,CD burning,music or data disc creating ,label creating ...etc)supported by roxio platinum 6 worked fine for the first several months. (note:I have not used it with DVD discs). <br /> Then the problems started. <br /> 1.Blank new CDs can not be formated any more. That means that the blank CDs can not be used for saving and burning since they require preparation and formatting. So my CD/DVD burner now is turned into a CD/DVD Rom drive. <br /> 2.The CD-RW disc that I successfully formated with the same software can now no more be used as formmated CD-RW (i.e a single file can not be removed unless the entire disc is erased) <br /> 3.The shortcut icon on the desktop sometimes does not respond to the mouse click as it used to several months ago. So I have to reboot my PC. <br /> 4.When I try to use other CD-R/RW which, on which I saved files <br /> using my old &quot;sony&quot; PC, Roxio patinum 6 recognized the disc and opened the files. BUT I could not save(add) new files because I got the message &quot;the disc is not formated&quot;. Formating it will erase all of the previously saved data in addition it ,formating,won`t be successfull.That what happened to me when I lost important data saved ondisc but the disc itself could not be formated.  <br /> Those problems left me with crappy software and CD/DVD burner. <br /> I used several CD brand &quot;Memorex,Sony, Staples,ofiice-depot&quot; but all ended with the same annoying and disappointing results. <br /> If you are willing to take a riks buy it. It might keep working fine with your PC and CD or CD/DVD burner for more than the initial few months  <br /> Thanks <br />  <br />	2004-08-03

I hope this helps others when deciding to buy this product or not.    \\"1) E-Filing should in principle always be included with the price of the product.    2) Having a \\"free federal E-File\\" while charging for the state E-File was not clear, and surely fooled a lot of customers, including me, as you surely intended.    3) The screen for entering capital gains via spreadsheet was extremely buggy.    4) The screen for capital loss carryovers was very poorly worded, and I'm still not sure if I entered the data correctly.    5) The Live Community Forum is a blatant attempt at dumping tech support questions on a bunch of other helpless Turbotax customers rather than do the tech support yourselves.  And by the way, I never received an answer to my questions.    6) The IRA to Roth conversion screens were very confusing.    7) You don't offer a Professional Review for the state products.    8) Requiring me to install Acrobat Reader, when I already had a differently branded .pdf file reader program, was unnecessary and annoying.    9) Turbotax, once all the b.s. fees are added on, is so expensive that it is probably better to just pay a professional tax preparer.  It might even cost roughly the same.\\"	2009-03-05

We originally chose the set because it had dinosaurs in it, and also getting the Safari rescue is just a great plus.<br /><br />Visually, the games are excellent, with smooth transitions, bright colors and fun animations. Throughout there are clear directions and the child cannot move ahead without listening to the directions. This makes the game play more independent. The writing in the Great Dinosaur Rescue is very good. I was actually enjoying the story line and learned a bit about dinosaurs.<br /><br />Both games are similar to the Diego show, with Diego, Alicia and baby Jaguar all helping to save other animals. \\"Click\\" the camera even makes appearances.<br /><br />The Great Dinosaur Rescue has a linear type of game play, with children moving through the game, helping \\"Maia\\" the Dinosaur find her family. My daughter was totally engrossed and loved the challenge. She learned about several kinds of dinosaurs and created an album. While on the quest, she is using matching, reasoning and computer skills.<br /><br />The Safari Rescue is fun and also a study of the animals and culture of the Serengeti. In both games, there are many science concepts to explore, as well as the more basic skills with counting, matching, vocabulary and Spanish.<br /><br />Overall, I rate this game highly. There is just a lot to do, and my four year old really enjoys it. I think she will be playing it for a while.<br /><br />*This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User Community (NDUC).

However, NOT ONE of the great functions that were disabled after the trial (clone brush, exposure/color settings, eraser, red eye removal, paint brush, etc.) are available in this software.<br /><br />Not a bad program, but having used a better version for a trial period, it leaves a lot to be desired.	2011-06-08

I read the Amazon reviews of the Norton Internet Security purchasers and was quite surprised.  I suspect that they were expecting a plug and play format and were willing to spend the extra money thinking they were getting some sort of hyper anti-virus package.  Internet Security is designed for a user who wants to define their own security system.  The problems explained in the previous reviews are easily remedied by a more experienced user.  If you don't take the time to learn Internet Security, you will get the tightest system possible and this will inhibit any Internet activity including e-mail.  I strongly recommend the basic Norton Anti-Virus software to anyone who is not willing to learn Internet Security.  To those who are experienced users or are willing to read the manual, Norton has again come out with a product that is superior to the competition. It is not a waste of time or money.	2005-02-19

Essentially the Trend firewall (running on my desktop PC) blocked all attempts to communicate from my laptop to the desktop. Despite multiple attempts to establish a variety of exception rules and 5 days of email exchanges with the Trend support team, the last instruction from the support team was to uninstall the firewall and give up! <br /> <br />I still use the anti-virus part of the software but downloaded a free firewall from [...] and it was up and running inside 2 minutes - and my home network works perfectly!	2005-03-08

The problem was due to the fact the form's buttons could not be displayed on high resolution screens.

It probably is the easiest program that I have EVER used.  I have Photoshop Elements and could have used it to create scrapbook pages, but I wanted something quick as a \\"click\\" or two and Memory Mixer does this.  From adding pictures, text, drop shadows, sizing, adding embleshments and more it has met my expectations and then some.  I have only made one book so far, but have had so much fun with it.  My kids have joined in and added their voices for narration for the DVD output, which I think will be priceless someday.  I am leading a yearbook class at our home school coop and have decided to use Memory Mixer as it will simplify everything from start to finish and will be so easy for my 10 to 12 year old students to master. It is compatible with Photoshop and even further effects can be accomplished when paired together, which I think is great.  I am not comfortable with buying products over the internet, so I did alot of research and found that many scrapbooking sites do recommend Memory Mixer.  Although it is somewhat pricey, everything else has fit my criteria; very easy to use, quick final product, beautiful not \\"cheesy\\" \\"papers\\" and \\"embellishments\\", can add products from internet.  Bonus benefits were the voice narration, \\"hot spots\\", music from my selections, and huge variety of output such as ordering a printed book, print at home, cd, dvd, web, etc.  I love Photoshop Elements for editing photos, but Memory Mixer is ideal for easy and creative digital scrapbooking.	2010-02-16

Microsoft Publisher saved me from having to pay a graphic designer $2000 for a book cover. I publish my own books, and I learned how to use MS Word to format my books. But I had no idea how to create a cover. It's possible to create covers in Word, but I wanted my covers to look nicer. So an author friend of mine told me that he had spent $2000 on book covers for his second book but didn't like any of them. So he bought MS Publisher and created his own cover.<br /><br />Some people complain that Publisher doesn't come with instructions. I see how that can be agrevating, but if you've used other MS Office products, it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out. I learned how within a matter of days. I think spending less than $200 instead of paying $2000 really made me like Publisher a lot.<br /><br />I've been exploring other things Publisher can do, and now I know how to make business cards, flyers, and mailing labels. Highly recommended, especially to self-published authors who need to design covers and can't afford graphic designers. (Although, I would rather do my own covers. I'm very obsessive about my books.)<br /><br />Brandon Simpson	2008-06-03

The bottom line is that the Abbyy FineReader Pro v5.0 is THE BEST OCR software on the market right now. It far surpasses Scansoft's Textbridge Millennium. The only thing that even gives FineReader Pro 5.0 any competition is Scansoft's OmniPage Pro 11, but FineReader is still far better. Since Scansoft bought out Textbridge (from Xerox) and bought out OmniPage (from Caere), you would think they could develop a superior product, but that's not so. Omnipage appears to be billed as an upgrade to Textbridge (I'm guessing that Scansoft is sending Textbridge to the graveyard). Scansoft claims in an advertisement that they spent a YEAR combining the programs. However, Scansoft did not even include rudimentary features of Textbridge in OmniPage 11. For instance, if you scan a book two pages at a time with the binding flat against the scanner (this is very common for older books that need to remain intact), Textbridge Millennium could split apart the pages using a dual-page mode. This was an extremely helpful if not critical feature for scanning books. However, this feature does not exist in OmniPage 11. FineReader on the other hand, can do this and more. It works great with Auto Document Feeders and it is far more accurate than OmniPage 11. Finally, FineReader's error/spell checker is once again far superior to OmniPage 11. The only single advantage that OmniPage 11 has over FineReader 5.0 is that it can import/output Adobe PDF documents. Otherwise FineReader Pro 5.0 is the way to go.	2001-07-13

Though it doesn't state it (at least at the time of this review) on the [web page]listing for QuickClean 3.0, it will also work on Microsoft Windows XP (which I have).<br />QuickClean helps you to quickly and safely remove many different types of junk on your hard drive, everything from invalid registry entries to incomplete applications. One of my favorite features of this program is the Uninstaller function, which can be set up to help remove those remnants of programs that you have removed from your computer.<br />QuickClean 3.0 improves upon its 2.0 predecessor mainly with the fact that McAfee has cleaned up the homepage. It is much easier to access the various functions within the program. In addition, it is also much easier to use the Instant Updater that comes with it to update not only QuickClean, but your other McAfee programs as well.<br />If you don't have this product, then it is definately worth buying. If you already have QuickClean 2.0, you can hold off spending the money on this new version unless you are able to get it for a very good price.	2002-09-10

I shouldn't have to jump through hoops for something that I should've received for free.<br /><br />If next years TT Deluxe includes all the functionality of previous (pre-2014) Deluxe versions, I will likely continue using it. If not, then I will most likely jump ship and give HR Block's tax software a try.	2015-02-04

When my 29 year old son left the hospital after suffering a traumatic brain injury [...] he had no memory and no ability to make memories.  As we were leaving Luby's cafeteria he looked at me and asked, \\"When are we going to eat?\\".  My first thought was that he still had his sense of humor, but quickly realized that he did not know that he had just eaten a large meal.<br /><br />Taking him back to his brain surgeon we were told that the damage was so extensive that he would probably never be able to remember anything.  Research on the Internet led us to the work of Michael Merzenich, PhD, with Posit Science.  A couple of phone calls later and we booked a flight to San Francisco to obtain the program and learn how to use it.  The results were astonishing to say the least.  Within 3 weeks of using the program for an hour a day, Ryan's ability to make memories became rapidly evident. By the time he finished the program he could recite a 10 digit phone number after hearing it just once and he began to get interested in his previous favorite TV show, Friends.<br /><br />A combination of the Brain Fitness and Cortex/Insight programs from Posit Science, FastForWord Scientific Learning programs, neurofeedback, Kumon and other modalities has enabled him to begin getting his life back together.  There are many videos of Ryan's journey of recovery on[...] just put Ryan Reitmeyer in the search bar.<br /><br />A .pdf version of the story is on the web [...]and we welcome your thoughts, comments and inquiries.  Our family will forever be thankful for the tremendous effort that the Posit Science team has put into their products.<br /><br />Ryan's father, Doug Reitmeyer	2008-10-17

The automation capabilities of Elements in this regard are so limited that it completely spoils this potentially great feature of Elements.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements 11 is reasonably satisfactory at minor photo editing and organizing your collection of digital photographs.  For serious editing with an Adobe product, the full Photoshop is required.  For editing alone, however, I have used several other brand graphic editors that have more useful features, are less expensive, and easier to use.<br /><br />The one potentially quite useful and unique feature of the Photoshop family (including Elements) is the ability to scan a group of photos, then separate the scan into the individual photos and straighten them.  Digitizing photos with Photoshop Elements is tedious due to poor software design, which requires user intervention at multiple steps which should be automatic.  Adobe pops up a dialog box for every single photo image it extracts from your scan, and each time asks to you to specify all the possible options for the file format you want to save the image in.  You have to repeatedly anwer the same dialog box to select the same options, e.g., for a tif file, over and over and over.  You also have to respond to a second dialog box to specify the name of the extracted image file, and manually mouse click to save each file.  Why can't Elements just ask you for a default set of file parameters, naming preferences, and offer the choice to automatically save, just once at the beginning of a batch of scans?  And then just follow your specified instructions as you then only have to do the scans?  Save time?  Hardly - with the same amount of mouse activity and image by image personal intervention, you could just as well use any other photo editor to select, rotate as needed, and save each image file.  This scan separate and straighten feature has been present with the same limitations in prior versons of Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, and Adobe didn't improve on it with this new software version at all.  By not understanding how their products will be used, Adobe has not bothered to allow you to set up a default set of file options for, say, the tif format, and not allowed you to automatically save each of the extracted, straightened images from your scan(s) with automatic naming and saving in the file format of your choice, requiring just one mouse click per entire group scan.  Other software programs have been able to save groups of images like that for years (using easy to set up macros).	2013-01-29

This is a real piece of junk of a tax prep. software for business.  I created an LLC last year so this is my first time having to file a tax return for a business.  Chose H&R over TurboTax because of the cost (almost 40% cheaper).  Anyway, it's a piece of crap.    1) If you use medium-sized font for your desktop (which I do since I have a 22\\" monitor), the fields and labels are all over the place, overlapping one another.  Contacted tech support via online chat and they told me to switch my desktop font back to small (default, 96DPI font). Geez, nice....    2) So I started a new return for my LLC, entered the entity name & EIN, etc. Few pages later, I'm being asked again the entity name and EIN.... DUUUUH.    3) The \\"interview questions\\" are bullcrap. They pretty much ask you the same questions as listed in the IRS forms. For example:  \\"For this tax year, did the partnership make an optional basis adjustment under section 743(b) or 734(b)?  [Yes] or  [No]\\"   I'm like, what the hell is \\"743(b) and 734(b)\\"??  If I have to read the IRS manual to fill this out, then why did I even bother with this software??    4) When you respond \\"No\\" to a question, then shouldn't the software skip the section?? It doesn't. You select NO, and it still takes you to the next section as if you had answered YES.  DUUUUH DUUUUHHHH.    There are several questions like that.  Anyway, I'm so fed up with this after 30 mins of use.  I need a refund for this crap.	2011-04-01

It has handled complex situations, such as when I married and my wife was a non-resident of the US.<br />However, in 2001, I spent some months working in California, so I must file dual-state returns between Virginia (resident) and California (non-resident). TurboTax doesn't handle this very well. It tells you to do your non-resident state return first, but unfortunately there's a weird setup between VA and CA that requires you to do VA first, even if you're a VA resident.<br />Granted, this is a quirk of the tax agreement between VA and CA, but be aware that the same situation exists between VA and a few other states.<br />Otherwise, a great product and I highly recommend it. From 2002 on, I am back to single-state returns, so I anticipate no problems at all.	2002-01-28

I'm sure it's OK for really simple stuff (so is Windows MovieMaker, which is free) but Adobe really fell down on many, many basic things here.  The point is this: if you're going to include a feature, make sure it works..right...all the time.  In other words, don't promise what you can't deliver.  I started it at 3 stars; I'm downgrading it to two.  I would quit and use something else, but I have too much time and energy invested in my project so I'm going to have to tough it out.<br /><br />If you are used to PhotoShop CS or Elements, and expecting even a decent PhotoShop experience, forget it.  This program is a frustrating mix of the familiar and a failure to deliver both the familiar and the logical.  (I make frequent reference to PhotoShop because many basic features of PS could have been incorporated and weren't.  It's not as if no one at Adobe were aware of the possibilities. Or maybe all those guys retired and didn't leave any notes?)<br /><br />Here are just a few of the serious limitations.  I have noted these more or less as they came up, although I've tried to organized them to some degree.  But any incoherence mirrors the incoherence of the program and its whims.<br /><br />Missing instructions in the Manual.  This is a huge time-waster, forcing you to spend hours on the internet trying to track down answers that should have been provided.  Example: from APE11 on, the previously Pro-only feature of \\"Time Remapping\\" is included.  Great news!  I could hardly wait to try it.  So I opened the PDF Manual (or \\"Tutorial\\" as Adobe prefers to call it--hedging their bets?--we never promised you a Manual?) and did a search for \\"Time Remapping.<br /><br />Here's what the instructions say:  \\"Tools: Provides options that let you add cool effects to your video. For example, use Time Remapping and Smart Mix to add sophisticated motion effects to your video.\\"  Wow, this does sound cool.  But they don't tell you anything about how it works or how to make it work.  Like, you know, instructions?  So I click to find the next occurrence...surely I'll find instructions there.<br /><br />Well, here's what I found: \\"In the Quick view, use the Time Remapping feature to reverse a clip.\\"  Period.  Does it work in the \\"Expert\\" view?  Who knows?  How do you use it?  Who knows?  The Manual appears to have been written for and by the kind of smart high-school kid who never reads the instructions, and loves to figure everything out by trial and error--kind of like hacking.  The rest of us are left to waste time rather than move forward with the projects that motivated us to buy the software in the first place..<br /><br />In the program itself, the two worst aspects are probably the Timeline and adding text (what AP12 refers to as \\"Titles\\").<br /><br />Timeline: when you move, alter or delete audio or video clips on the various tracks, the program has a disastrous habit of arbitrarily moving clips on other tracks.  This occurs even though the clips in question are not linked or grouped and have never been linked or grouped.  If you have material on several tracks, you can't see this happening because not all the tracks are visible.  So often, it's too late to just \\"Undo\\" without trashing quite a bit of work.  This can be insanity-producing after you have painstakingly aligned various tracks on the timeline to get everything synchronized, and APE12 moves everything around.  So you have to undo whatever you did in the meantime (go into History and retreat to a prior state).  Then try again, cautiously, hoping that you won't upset the sleeping ogre.  Terribly time-wasting, distracting and inefficient.  Buggy program should have been fixed.<br /><br />The program also has trouble if you attempt to close a gap between two clips (audio or video) if there is anything above or below the gap on an adjacent clip.  In this case at least it won't move things arbitrarily; instead it just disallows your attempt.  (Delete and close gap is grayed out.)  You can get better results if you vacate the clip above or below.  But sometimes this doesn't help, either.  This is a terrible workflow situation.  Buggy program should have been fixed.<br /><br />Another cute Timeline feature is the program's habit of arbitrarily putting new clips on various tracks.  Say you are adding text to a number of places on the timeline.  You add one, then on to the next  Then you realize that some of them are missing!  Have they somehow been dropped, or never added?  Don't worry, they are still there, but you can't see them because APE has decided to put them 2 tracks above the one you're working on, so that they aren't visible unless you either scroll up, or reduce the size of the preview window.  Buggy program should have been fixed.<br /><br />APE12 will sabotage your best efforts at combining audio and video.  You have selected a nice background track and inserted it, so that you could see how it works with the video.  Great!  Now, some final touches.  How about some freeze frames at key moments?  Add drama!  So you insert freeze frames into your video.  Each time you do so, unbeknown to you (because the audio track isn't visible in the part of the timeline you're working on) APE12 will cut the soundtrack and leave an audio gap at that point.  It makes no difference if the tracks are adjacent (they are not) or linked or grouped (they are not).  APE12 will trash the audio track, making mucho extra work for you.  Either you have to drag all the audio tracks back together, or just delete them anb re-import the original, get it synched again, etc.  This is either a bug or unbelievably bad programming.  Also: once you have cuts in the audio track, there is no way to change the volume of all of the segments at once--you have to do each one separately.  More work--thanks to this really dumb aspect of the program.<br /><br />Titles/text in general is very poorly designed and very buggy.  User-defined defaults and other setting are often ignored, and a selected font may suddenly change the moment you place the cursor on it.  There is no easy way to generate, move, arrange, etc. as you can in Photoshop (why can't you just put the cursor where you want it, and start typing?).  Vast choice of fonts, but there is no short list of recently used fonts, so at each editing session--and each time in a session when the program ignores the default you have chosen--you have to scroll s-l-o-w-l-y down and find the one you used last time.  Once you have set everything to a font, size, and other parameters (bold, italic, etc.) you may or may not get them, even though the \\"titler\\" shows everything set up the way you want it.  For example, you might set font size at 68pt; the setting will show 68 but in reality the font has remained at some other size.  It may take you several settings and re-settings to get it right.  The same is true of bold, bold extended, and so on.  This is not only an incredible time-waster, but it's often impossible to know what you really have, since the UI is showing settings that may or may not  be the ones you really have.<br /><br />Subtitles: very primitive and awkward.  Interesting \\"animation\\" effects, but can only be used on one line of a one-line text title.  This is not explained anywhere in the manual, so you will waste lots of time trying to figure out why the \\"Apply\\" button is grayed out.  After you get that straightened out, you will waste more time creating multiple one-line bits of text and applying the desired animation to each of them.  The default animations themselves only last 3 seconds or so, so you will waste more time trying to figure out how to get them to a length that any normal person would want.  The entire process is clumsy, time-consuming, and not explained.<br /><br />Unlike PhotoShop (even old PSE6) there is no way to make a global change of font, font size, etc. if you have a number of titles on the timeline.  You have tochange each one.  The buggy program makes this hard, as your settings are often ignored, even when you change them manually.  Doing things over and over is a real time-killer and destroys concentration and work flow.<br /><br />There is no simple way to generate a single subtitle track (such as would be needed for any film with different languages in it, any film that would be viewed by non-speakers of the language, any film that is a description of procedure).  The mentality makes you think of the silent film era, where instead of subtitles they would interrupt the action from time to time with a few frames of written dialog.<br /><br />When you encounter difficulties, you turn to the manual, right?  This can be an exercise in frustration.  The manual is wordy and spends lots of space telling you about how easy the program is to use, instead of actually making it easy by telling you clearly and precisely what to do to attain certain results.  This is compounded by ambiguity (as in Adobe's use of \\"title\\" to refer to a project and also to any text that you want to include in the project).<br /><br />Let's say you want to blend audio or otherwise fade in and out (a common thing to want to do) on one or more tracks.  Here's what you find in the Manual: \\"Adobe Premiere Elements includes two audio transitions in the Crossfade category: Constant Power and Constant Gain. Though both provide fades, they differ slightly. Constant Power creates a smoother-sounding fade, while Constant Gain, though mathematically linear, often sounds abrupt.<br />\\"1. Click Transitions on the Action bar. The Transitions panel appears.<br />\\"2. Click the thumbnail for any video transition to set it in motion.\\"<br /><br />Huh?  Weren't we talking about audio?  Turns out that if you DON'T do as you're told, and instead click on a little down arrow above \\"3-D Motion,\\" you will get a pull-down with Audio Transitions as the last item on it.  (It's like looking for Easter Eggs when you were a kid!  Let's see, where could they be hidden...)  There are two Audio transitions shown: constant gain and constant power.  That's it.  So it's back to the drawing board.<br /><br />The manual leaves out many important details, and also includes sequences of steps that do not exist as described.  For example, reference is made to various \\"tools\\" but no mention of where they are hidden or what their icons look like.<br /><br />Example: the Manual (or \\"Tutorial\\" as Adobe likes to call it) says that you may need to copy and paste using the \\"Expert\\" Timeline.  Well, yeah, that's rather obviously true.  Unfortunately, although they tell you how to select a clip, they don't bother to tell you how to copy and paste.  Isn't this obvious?  Not when after you've copied, all the \\"paste\\" options you can find anywhere are grayed out.  So you'll waste a lot of time trying to figure why all the \\"paste\\" options are grayed out, and how to perform this simple operation.  When you finally find the answer, you wonder why they didn't make like every other program: put the cursor where you want to paste, and either select \\"paste\\" or Crtl-V.  You'll find that the Ctrl-V works, but putting the cursor where you want it doesn't.  Which means that you can't choose the track where the clip is pasted.  (Spoiler alert: I later found out that there is a way, but it's neither direct, nor obvious, nor efficient.  See below for more on this.)<br /><br />Example: \\"In the Project Assets panel, select New Item from the Panel options.\\"  There is nothing labeled \\"Panel options.\\"  Turns out they are hidden and to see them you have to click on a very small down arrow symbol which opens a pull-down menu.<br /><br />Another example, when you're trying to reposition text: \\"In the Monitor panel, click the Selection Tool...\\"  But there is no \\"Selection Tool.\\" In reality, you have to Right click the text area in the Monitor Panel.  A pull-down menu will appear, from which you can choose \\"Position.\\"<br /><br />This all seems very passive-aggressive.  It forces you to guess and waste time and work for everything.  The entire documentation is like trying to help you learn to play the piano by describing a piano.  (An Adobe piano course would say things like, \\"You can quickly and easily play a \\"C\\" on more than one octave!  An octave consists of notes...\\")  Plus false leads.<br /><br />APE12 also finds ways to make simple things more complex.  For example, you can drag a video clip from the \\"Project Assets\\" panel directly to the Timeline.  Great!  But now suppose that you want to drag another clip to a track above the first one.  You know, to create an effect by blending the two clips, changing the transparency and characteristics of the top clip (like you would in Layers in Photoshop).  So you try to drag.  Nada.  So you spend time trying to find out why this simple operation isn't available.  You find out that you have to drag the clip to the Preview Window, then open a menu, then make the right choice to move the clip.  But APE12 will move the clip to \\"the first available\\" video track.  Meaning that if you have titles (text)--which are of necessity located on a video track above the first track (like text layers in Photoshop)--or anything else with spaces between, APE12 will consider that track to be \\"available\\" and will dump the clip onto that track if there's a big enough space.  If you don't want the clip there (which you probably don't), you have to relocate it, and if you have a lot of tracks and a lot of material, you'll have to find it so you can relocate it.  So what should have been a simple, one-step operation--drag clip to where you want it--becomes a combination maze and treasure hunt.  There are many such in APE12.  (Copy & paste, above, is one.)  It's as if someone in the design section realized that various features had been left out, couldn't figure out a sensible way to fit them into the architecture, and just stuck them on at the end.  Leaving the user to struggle.<br /><br />You can probably accomplish almost anything you want with this program, but often it is going to involve kludges, work-arounds (such as saving to an external file and then re-introducing into the project) and other time-wasting and work-flow-interrupting techniques.  You will find far more useful information from those who know the program than you will from the Manual (or \\"Tutorial\\" as Adobe likes to call it).<br /><br />There are many, many online posts about these and other issues, not only with the Elements version but also with the Pro version. Just check Adobe forums or Elements Village, for examples.<br /><br />Some users express the belief that customers are paying for the privilege of being beta testers and at times it seems that way.<br /><br />My experience with APE12 is that it is temperamental (AKA buggy) and with key features that seem to have been designed by people who don't do video, much less video editing. They often make a simple operation as complex as possible. (\\"To start your car, open the trunk and throw in the keys. Close the trunk. Next, open the driver's door and get in.

Put the key into the ignition and start the car.\\")<br /><br />I exaggerate, but not by much.<br /><br />I'm thankful for people on the forums who willingly give their time to find and share solutions.<br /><br />I will continue to slog through this thing (I have a project that I need to do, and so far this is the only tool at my disposal).  It's going to take me at least 3x longer than it should, because of the slipshod design and implementation of the program.  (I'm writing this during a crash.)<br /><br />I would not pay the original list price, and probably wouldn't pay over $50; in fact, if I had known it was this clumsy I would have spent more time looking at alternatives like Sony (I did research it, but the reviews for APE actually seemed better.) There are just too many deficiencies in APE.t's see, where could they be hidden...)  There are two Audio transitions shown: constant gain and constant power.  That's it.  So it's back to the drawing board.<br /><br />The manual leaves out many important details, and also includes sequences of steps that do not exist as described.  For example, reference is made to various \\"tools\\" but no mention of where they are hidden or what their icons look like.<br /><br />Example: the Manual (or \\"Tutorial\\" as Adobe likes to call it) says that you may need to copy and paste using the \\"Expert\\" Timeline.  Well, yeah, that's rather obviously true.  Unfortunately, although they tell you how to select a clip, they don't bother to tell you how to copy and paste.  Isn't this obvious?  Not when after you've copied, all the \\"paste\\" options you can find anywhere are grayed out.  So you'll waste a lot of time trying to figure why all the \\"paste\\" options are grayed out, and how to perform this simple operation.  When you finally find the answer, you wonder why they didn't make like every other program: put the cursor where you want to paste, and either select \\"paste\\" or Crtl-V.  You'll find that the Ctrl-V works, but putting the cursor where you want it doesn't.  Which means that you can't choose the track where the clip is pasted.

The film is at least a decade old - they show the Raiders football team in the L.A. Coliseum - they moved back to Oakland in 1995! Its obvious the production was not filmed with high-definition cameras, but was remastered to a higher pixel count without any increase in quality.

When Lightroom came out, I initially had a difficult time deciding where it fit, as I was trying to place it between PSE and Photoshop.<br /><br />Lightroom is a really terrific photo manager and retoucher, and while there is a learning curve from PSE, it is much easier for simple retouching - and much easier for some complex filtering and enhancements.  It handles RAW files in a much more 'integrated' fashion than PSE, making it much simpler to stay in RAW file mode.  The free demo is worth taking a look at if you're on the fence.	2013-09-15

Went on the Hoyle forum nice people but could not help and suggested sending issue to tech assistance (no promise of response or even acknowledgement) thought best recourse was to get refund.<br /><br />Installed second time long wait for autorun to begin. This time it went through registration. I thought it was good sign. Wrong.<br /><br />I believe that the program has a compatibility problem with Windows 7 64 bit. On both installs, in Omaha Hold-em the program reported hands that were not on the screen. At times I needed 6 cards to register a flush. With a pair in the hole and one card match to a pair on the flop, awarded only three of a kind. When opposition was declared as a full house but I could not see it on the screen I removed it and took it back for refund.<br /><br />BTW Another gripe in 7 card poker you can't always see all the cards because they're obscured by some of the players' graphic and the program's hand declaration is not contrasted enough to read. But the Hearts play is very good  with excellent card visuals	2012-03-02

So I bought Finale Guitar. What a mistake. <br /> <br />IMHO, Finale is not even a proper GUI application. This program has the worst interface I have ever seen, to the point of being almost unuseable unless you spend hours a day with it.  <br /> <br />Here's what I mean: In a typical Windows program, you select an object and then the program shows you what you can do with it. Select, then manipulate. That's not new; it's been a tenet of GUI design since day one. <br /> <br />Oh, but not with Finale, though. There are almost a dozen different \\"tools,\\" and you have to know in advance which tool contains the function that you need before you can even select the item that you want to change. That's annoying, but it's aggravated by the fact that functions are not necessarily associated with the tool that makes sense.  <br /> <br />And it gets worse, because the \\"help system\\" is nothing more than a gazillion MB PDF of the manual. Tooltips? Fuhgeddaboutit. Context help? Are you kiddin' me? I defy any new user to change the key of a song without consulting at least two sections of the manual. <br /> <br />Everything about this program is harder to use than it needs to be. I guess this must be to maintain compatibility with the 1980s DOS version or something, because I can think of no reason why someone would design a Windows or Mac program to work in such a non-intuitive and bass-ackwards fashion. <br /> <br />I'm switching to Sibelius, which is what I should have bought in the first place. I can't get Finale off of my computer soon enough.	2006-02-06

My new camcorder needs more current software, so I downloaded trials of version 10 & Pro 10. Not much new for version 10, but it does work with my canon HF S200 .mts vid files. Let's see what Pro 10 has that I can't live without.     First thing with any project is the opening credits. This thing has a Pro Titler, looks interesting. Hmmm, a \\"fly in\\" text option that looks cool. Choose \\"Fly In\\" & it gives you the title \\"The brown fox\\". Great, can I edit this text ? NO ? Do I have any use for \\"The brown fox\\" on any credits ? Nope, sorry.     Let's try this: added my own text block. Why can't I apply fly in to it? How about this: Play the timeline, now I can text edit \\"The brown fox\\". Now what ? It's no longer a fly in title & most of my text went to oblivion! HUHHHHH ? Check the tutorial, search for \\"fly in\\" & nothing. Several related searches about the pro titler & more nothing.     Searched online & nothing. Sony has no support unless you start throwing money at them.  You mean I have to pay to learn how to use this to see if I like it ? Do you think I'm gullible ?   Do I look like a CEO ? Obama ? A carnie/circus freak ? ( yes I know, not much difference between CEOs, Obama & circus freaks ).     Congrats sony, you frustrated me & I give up with the 1st object on my timeline.   I don't need guessing games. I need software I can use.     P.S. Sony Pro 10 can hang and run really slow. Sometimes ir generates .net OS errors.

But be WARNED! Parallel's customer support is simply the worst! And do NOT buy a retail version unless you are certain it is Version 3. I know the Amazon tag says latest version, but it doesn't say Version 3. If you buy and get version 2, you will get a free upgrade from Parallels, BUT IN EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS! And you have to dig around their web site to find the right link to get the upgrade info. I find this inexcusable.     This is totally shabby treatment of customers who buy retail, like from Amazon. You end up with the old product, and no way to get your free upgrade in a timely fashion.    So, if you really need this product (and I did), don't buy from a retail outlet unless you are positive you will be getting Version 3. And then don't be surprised with totally crappy support. The ONLY way to get any support is to read their forums ([...]), which they don't really tell you about in any easy to find place, and which have lots of information, but are difficult to sort through.    UPDATE: I guess most of the problems I had aren't much of an issue now. Now it is just the product. I know Parallels has gotten pretty good reviews as a product, but I gave up on it. After using it a while, I just kept having problems. Finally, VMWare Fusion was released, and that was a breath of fresh air. While VMWare might lack a few of the gee-wiz features of Parallels, it works, and it works well. None of the problems and crashes I was getting with Parallels. My recommendation: VMWare Fusion.	2007-06-09

It had a clean user interface with lots of useful features that didn't seem to go overboard. Subsequent releases of Money have been plagued with &quot;featuritis&quot;, as the war with Quicken continues. Money 2002 is by far the worst victim of this disease. Microsoft added so many new features with little concern for their cost on performance. It got so bad that entering and editing data become almost as slow as handwriting it in a checkbook and using an abacus to calculate the results.<br />Finally, with Money 2003, Microsoft has begun to marry features with performance that returns to the speeds we loved in Money 2000. The interface and bells and whistles are similar to 2002, but the performance gain is exhilarating. If you've waited to upgrade and passed over previous versions, but have been itching to use some of Money's sophisticated online banking features, Money 2003 will be worth the leap.	2002-08-14

After downloading the 30 day trial, I was excited to see many great features like project and task management - it expands on Outlooks ability considerably.  I also found projects and to-dos synced well with my iPhone's Reminders.  HOWEVER, it is beyond painfully slow to open and operate and slows my system down, causing my Outlook to report \\"Not Responding\\" for almost 5-7 seconds, and then it would take another 5-10 seconds to load the HomeView itself.  Great features, but is literally unusable unless you have the time and patience - ironic a tool for busy professionals can't be used by busy professionals.  I contacted the support desk, which was unfortuantely another waste of time.  The agent first said the response time was not unusual and frequently takes a while to load.  Her only recommendations were to uninstall or repair Outlook and my .pst file, both of which work fine outside of the PlanPlus environment.  When I asked why I would want to repair those files if they were not corrupted, her response was, \\"Abbey: You're welcome to take or not take any troubleshooting advice; I'm not sure if it will improve the speed either.  But what you're describing isn't an unusual amount of time for PlanPlus to take to load your data.\\"  It solicited a chuckle from me, and I appreciated her honesty.  I feel bad for the technical support professionals who are trying to support an inherently poorly written and executed product.  I don't think there is anything tech support can do to solve the problems with the program.  It's a shame what looks like a good product is unusable in a busy environment.  I would look elsewhere for an Outlook add-in.  Plan Plus will only bring frustration.	2012-01-19

When Corel Draw first appeared in the 1990's the program was a simple image editing software anyone could use. Over time competitor Adobe and their creative suite established itself as the graphic industry standard with it's illustrator, photoshop and indesign programs defining many of the techniques, shortcuts and quality that professionals have come to expect. Having use both programs I was excited to use the latest CorelDraw program as previous version were actually easier to manipulate and edit images than Adobe's sometimes annoying muti-step editing.<br /><br />The Graphics suite contains Corel's versions of photoshop and illustrator called Corel PhotoPaint. I started by editing photos and touching up basic images. I found the program to be quite capable of retouching photos and offered a good variety of textures of image editing options. Corel gives the user the option to save images in various image types.<br /><br />CorelDraw was quite a bit more complicated to use. While I found some of the editing and image creation to annoying as I am so used to Adobe's shortcuts and capabilities most of CorelDraw's drawbacks stem from it's overly complicated steps. Just to rotate basic items required 2-3 steps. While I believe that if I continued using this software I would become more comfortable with it's quirks it seems a bit convoluted at times.<br /><br />I think this is a solid image editing software for the amateur designer and with a far nicer price that Adobe's creative suite. However, because Adobe is almost universally used in advertising and graphic design companies I can't see many professionals adopting this program.	2012-02-24

I am still not a big fan of the \\"Ribbons\\", which are the user interface tools that Microsoft Office now uses instead of menus and toolbars.  If you were proficient at a previous version of Office, the Ribbons are NOT as intuitive as they would have you believe (it is a strange feeling, to be sitting there thinking I know exactly what I want to do, but I can't find the command).  The ribbons are not as customizable as the old menus and toolbars were in previous versions.  I believe that I will get use to them and I would  guess that a new user would have no problem with them.    Aside from the Ribbon bars, the rest of the suite seems very similar to previous versions that I am familiar with.  I don't think that I would purchase this as an upgrade, but this was good for me because I did not previously have a personal version of Office (only had it on my work machine).	2008-07-27

I recently upgraded (a clean install) my two desktops and laptop to Windows 7 and installed BitDefender on all three immediately afterward.  Installation was easy and not as time consuming as I feared, though the deep scan of my nearly empty hard drives took several hours.  My one desktop had over 20 infected files, while the other two had less than ten.  BitDefender took care of the bad files without trying to confuse me about the dangers of erasing things my computer may need.  I hated that about other security software I've owned over the years.     The only bump in the road was when it asked for my e-mail address to register and it would not because it said that I was not connected to the internet.  I was connected, so I chose to register later.  I'm hoping that issue will be resolved by the time it asks again.    I will say that BitDefender Internet certainly takes care of people like me that don't bother with instructions.     I really like the dashboard.  Everything just makes sense.  I did have to search a little and read the help file when I wanted to disable the anti-virus in order to re-install my scanner, but that was no big deal.    Bottom line is that my computer is protected unobtrusively.  I control the notifications and have not noticed a slowdown in performance.	2011-01-03

That was the first clue about how the two mapping software programs compare.<br /><br />I was not able to test how well this program shares it's information with a Garmin GPS since I don't have one. I use a Magellan.<br /><br />Using the program is a bit clunky. For example, if I try to measure the distance between two points, the program will draw a line with lots of points between the starting and ending points. It is difficult to remove once you create it and it needlessly marks up your view. Further, after creating a route, and then trying to zoom and move around the route, several times I accidentally caused the program to change the route and I had to start over.<br /><br />I believe the program provides too much information when creating a route. What I mean is when you are driving on an interstate, let's say I95, and you need to stay on I95 until you get to I495. I don't need, or want, 15 lines of information guiding me between those two points. I would prefer to simply know that I need to stay on I95 for x number of miles and then to get onto I495.<br /><br />It would be very very nice if I could draw a rectangle and have the program zoom to the area within that rectangle. Instead, what you get for zooming is using the plus (zoom in) and minus (zoom out) buttons. I found it difficult to follow a route when using this because it often zooms too much (or too little) and it doesn't always zoom exactly where you would want it to forcing you to re-navigate to where you wanted to look at.<br /><br />Overall, the only reason I find that I would want to use this program (instead of using Mapquest on the internet) is if I didn't have access to the internet. So, it would be useful if it was loaded on a laptop during a trip.	2013-10-08

As with any upgrade or new program, things do not always get better. Biggest problem, trying to find features you were used to for many years with previous programs. I find two issues disturbing. When closing a document in Word, the whole program stops, whereas you do the same in Excel, yo get an empty screen and can open a new file, while being in the program. In Word, every time you close a document you have to start up the Word program if you want to look for another file. Time consuming! Also, in Excel you are able to save a document in previous versions. In Word it does not have that option, if you want to save a file from i.e. Outlook in another folder than available in Outlook. In the new version you get all files twice in a directory (folder), because it also keeps all the Word features for each document in a separate folder. Too much! Since I use Outlook and Word more than any other programs, I find the above issues a handicap. This besides trying to learn where all the new features are, which are supposedly easier to find. Might be true once you get used to it.	2007-04-06

This is, hands down, absolutely unbelievable outstanding product! I used to be a Photoshop user, but this Corel photo suite is in my opinion even better than Photoshop. I can create unbelievable images in no time with great ease and totally professional results. I've been playing a lot with pictures of family, and the results, again, are truly outstanding. I have spent already $60 in sending prints to the lab to frame them, because those pictures are too good to be kept in a hidden place. The bottom line of this product is that you get professional results for amateur photographers or the general public, and all is done via a very friendly interface that anybody can use without much guessing. It just makes sense. I am hoping to get the feel of the whole thing, and eventually, also be able to edit some videos. But again, as I said above, I do take lots of pictures but rarely shoot video. It's just worth the price for photographers alone. I use a Canon EOS digital camera, so my pictures are great quality. This just makes the whole thing even better.

This software only gets a rating of 1 star because that is Amazon's minimum. IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE SOLD FOR MARYLAND USE. I have filed taxes in Maryland for nearly 30 years. For a long time Maryland has had a subtraction on joint returns for two incomes. Turbo Tax State asks the correct questions in order to calculate the two income subtraction but does not include this subtraction in calculating the tax due. I initially did our taxes according to the state instructions and calculated that we were entitled to the maximum subtraction of $1200. When I used Turbo Tax State it calculated our taxes as $93 higher. It is impossible to determine the source of this error on the computer so I printed out our return. That shows that the amount on line 16 (Two-income subtraction) was zero. This is a completely unacceptable error in the software. Turbo Taxes' support is so poor that it is virtually impossible to get any help with this problem. I will NEVER buy this software again.	2004-02-20

I have almost 20,000 photos to manage, and iPhoto does a good job. I hope to use Garageband at some point after I get a new music keyboard, although that isn't necessary.     I am disappointed with iMovie, though. They really dumbed-down its capabilities. For many people, it may be easier, if all you want to do is some minor processing and move your recorded video onto a DVD. However, they removed a lot of tools for actually creating a video presentation. To get a lot of what iMovie used to have, you either have to get the old version (can you still downgrade for free? not sure), or purchase the $300 Final Cut Express (which, of course, gives you a lot more than even old iMovie had).    Worth the $80, but there are things I would like to see Apple improve in iPhoto, as much as I like it.  There are some things that are hard to manage using keyboard shortcuts, some of the interface has odd non-Mac-standard behavior, and I've had some issues with Smart Albums.  I hope they continue to improve it, but it's definitely worth what it costs.	2008-08-31

It took awhile to get used to the new style.  As many others have mentioned, the menus are completely different than the menus of Office 2003 and prior.  In fact, Microsoft calls them \\"ribbons\\" instead of menus now since almost everything you need is in toolbars at the top of the page instead of the old drop-down menus of yore.  This takes some getting used to.  I feel completely comfortable with computers and it still took me a couple weeks of heavy use before I really started feeling comfortable.<br /><br />Going from Office 2007 to 2010 isn't a huge jump.  The 2010 version is just more stream lined than 2007.  The menus feel more intuitive.  I don't feel like I have to seek out basic functions, like I did with 2007.<br /><br />Even though 2010 is easier to use than 2007, I don't recommend paying to upgrade.  It's just not worth it.  If you're still using Office 2003, it's definitely worth upgrading to 2010.  My workplace still uses Office 2003 and difference between the programs is huge.  I find myself getting frustrated with 2003 when I know 2010 does things much more smoothly.<br /><br />I also prefer MS Office to Open Office (a free productivity suite).  I'm not a huge Microsoft fan, but again, Office 2010 makes Open Office feel slow and clunky.<br /><br />I recommend Office 2010.  It will take some getting used to if you're coming from Office 2003, but it's well worth the learning curve.	2010-12-16

The transaction with Amazon was great and the installation was smooth.  However, I ran into a problem with the bundled software.  Customer service gave me two options: PAY for the option to speak to a person or communicate through chat.  Not wanting to pay for help, I chatted with them, but they had no idea how to solve my problem nor did they believe that I legally purchased the product.  If you get this, then hope it runs fine or you'll be stuck with customer service that has made it very hard to get help from.	2011-04-23

My previous purchase of the Roxio VHS to DVD unit was returned because it was so bad.  This Honestech VHS to DVD 5.0 Deluxe product is great.  Worked the first time and every time it has been used.  I am archiving my collection of over 800 old VHS tapes before they degrade too badly.  The only irritating point is there is no sound cut off provision when recording.  I have to turn off my speakers unless I want to hear the entire movie while working on the computer.  Other than that, operation is smooth and easy.  I recommend it.	2013-01-13

Desktop with 1.5 gigs of memory and 2.8 Pentium 4 with XP home edition.  Installed with some problems that cleared when rebooted twice.  Seems to be working ok.  No virus detected except some tracking cookies.    2. Laptop with 1 gig of memory with XP home edition.  Did not install correctly and required the removal program from Symantec to clean up the mess.  Intalled ok with again more reboots then instructions call for.  No virus detected except some tracking cookies.    3. Desktop with 1 gig of memory with XP professional.  This computer is used as a server with a two POS terminals.  Installation was a disaster.  Required removal and install four times.  Norton is still not working correctly as a error code 3035,7 is being generated.    Recommendations:    Install some other product.  Norton is not a product for the faint of heart.  If you insist on installing Norton then read on:    Probably will not have a problem on an ordinary fairly new system.  I would make the recommendation that you use the removal tool from the Symantec website if doing an upgrade from an older Norton product. Not using the removal tool before upgrading may trash your system.  Warning - this removal tool removes other Norton products not just the one you are upgrading.  My server system would not recognize the POS terminals when I removed Norton via Windows Add/Removal.  Only the Symantec removal tool cleaned up the mess plus removal of other Norton products.    Product support from Symantec consists of instructions from \\"Kuzar\\" which are obvious script support.  The instructions had me clear the temporary files and use the Symantec Removal Tools then install Norton again.  Start in the safe mode and scan the system for virus.  Of course this ignores that Norton 2006 was installed to keep the viruses out.  Other procedures were followed even when they did not make logical sense. So far I have about 60 hours into this. Have not gotten any further support for two weeks after following the script procedures.  Good luck	2007-09-08

I guess 7 came out because Vista (based on massive virtualization) was such a bomb.  Maybe it was bottom-line also - just to come out with something new to sell.  But I think there was a strong component of Digital Rights Management in both Vista and 7 - that's probably the main reason for both Vista and 7.

My parents are minimalist computer users - email, CNN, and long distance screen-shares with me using ScreenLeap - such that they are not clicking on every weird website or extension in cyberspace.<br /><br />Here is what you should consider before you buy - such that you don't repeat my VERY EXPENSIVE experience.<br /><br />1)  My parent's have an annual subscription with all the appropriate updates.  I check their McAfee tab for protection status both when I am visiting and via long distance screen share - it always says everything is fine.<br /><br />Unfortunately that has not been the case as my parents have been plagued by pop-ups and related malware that I would have to do special diagnosis and repair on.<br /><br />2)  Last week I booked air fare to visit as they needed some things done, including more computer assistance.  I had accessed McAfee's website in advance and reviewed their service options and did screen prints of the support phone numbers and the like - including all the &#34;service awards&#34; they claim.<br /><br />I had researched all the current malware products - free and for charge - and was ready to replace McAfee (since it repeatedly didn't work) with someone like BitDefender or the like.<br /><br />Prior to doing so I accessed the McAfee folder on my parent's computer checking everything for possible clues or easy fixes.  I went through their program inventory looking for recent entries or things that didn't look right.  Then - to be thorough - I called McAfee to see if they could find a simple fix to the recurrent failure of their software on my parent's machine.<br /><br />I got a very nice sounding individual who did a screen-share highlighting a host of &#34;problem areas&#34; that required &#34;immediate attention&#34; taking about 40 minutes all in.  At this juncture I'm thinking McAfee has good customer support.<br /><br />THEN- after 40 minutes of seemingly well-intended support identifying problems (real or for effect) he tells me that they are most willing to immediately fix these dire issues and he must transfer me to a colleague who will resolve everything to my complete satisfaction while on the screen share.<br /><br />What can I say?  It seems great, I made a thousand mile trip with fixing the computer as a priority so I say &#34;yes, please fix all the problems that our McAfee subscription let in&#34;.<br /><br />Now the blindside...<br /><br />Up until now there had been no mention of any cost - none, nada, zip.  Now the hammer.  He tells me that today's fix will cost $179.99, but that for some $300+ (which he strongly recommends) my parent's can be fully protected for a year - Otherwise the $179.99 is only warrantied for 2 weeks.<br /><br />I protest saying there was no mention until now and the whole reason we are even talking is the McAfee product we bought and paid for - until well into 2015 - didn't work as advertised.<br /><br />Nope - if I want to be able to use the computer it will be a MINIMUM charge of $179.99.  I clinched my teeth and gave them my credit card number and they (hopefully) did a screen-share repair session.<br /><br />After returning home to the East Coast I called McAfee to advise that I thought I/my parents had been subject to a misleading service experience very close to &#34;bait & switch&#34;.  I talked at length with a Customer Service Supervisor - Bryan - and documented the charges on my card and my parent's valid McAfee subscription.<br /><br />Bryan listened and advised me that any malware product had loopholes and my customer service request was outside scope of normal McAfee customer support and the belated advisory of a potential charge (a huge freaking charge) was perhaps my misunderstanding.<br /><br />For disclosure - I did not purchase this McAfee subscription via Amazon (whom I find to have very high customer service standards).  However, this is one of the more unsavory bait & switch type experiences I personally have experienced from a vendor I had thought to have had a positive brand image.<br /><br />This is particularly relevant if - like me - you are trouble shooting for elderly relatives who are easy prey for people like McAfee.	2014-08-19

As a journal editor, I receive manuscripts written in Word 2000 or WordPerfect. WordPerfect is the superior work processor in my experience.<br />However, the current &quot;upgrade&quot; from WordPerfect 9 to version 10 isn't worth the expenditure. The bugs in WP9 are mostly still there. I have found very little improvement in WP10 with respect to manuscript preparation, graphics, and file management. As one who uses Windows XP, I don't find WP10 fully compatible. Accessing a WP10 file can turn into a frustrating experience when the system goes into some kind of unresolvable loop, forcing an exit from WP10. I am also frustrated that the Corel calendar keeps trying to insert itself at system startup, even though I had indicated to the contrary during WP10 installation.<br />I will continue to use WordPerfect, but have decided to drop back to WP 9. The frustrations are fewer.	2002-06-27

I used it for a couple of days and didn't like it. Thought it was more suited for drawing cartoons and doing weird things to photos. Sold it.    I download a 30 day free trial of Adobe PhotoShop Elements 8. Don't particularly like it either. I probably didn't give Corel enough of a chance.    I don't know what other software might be out there, but both Corel and Adobe have 30 day free trials of these products. I suggest you download one and try it for the full 30 days, and learn as much about it as possible. What it can do, what it can't do, what more you want it to do. See what plug-ins that you might want are available for it, and how much they cost. Then download the other and try it. Give it a full try before deciding. I've come across mentions of other software, but didn't pay much attention.    If you are new to photo editing, as I am, this is a really steep learning curve. Perhaps, before you even start with a program, get a book on the current or recent software from the local library, give it a moderate go-thru, and get an understanding of photo editing software. Just finding out what plug-ins are available, and where to find them is a chore.    Can't say much about Corel as I didn't use it much. This is what I think of PhotoShop Elements so far.    Has more features for doing simple, home type editing of photos than the free stuff that I have seen. Some of the features are nice to have. (GIMP is large, capable, and free. I've heard that it is buggy and difficult to learn and use. Not at all something to begin with.)    Elements is a little buggy, but not too bad comparatively. Twenty-five years ago there were software companies that actually put out well designed, working software. Microsoft put out buggy garbage, put money into hyping it, and sold it. In order to compete, other companies had to follow suit. The result being, poorly designed, poorly operating, buggy software, that has been the norm for some time now. And we no longer expect anything different. Elements may be a little better than average. ( I use Windows XP. )    There are a whole bunch of resources out there, put out by Adobe, to learn Elements. There needs to be, because not one bit of it is complete. You will spend many hours tracking it down. So far, I would say that all of it together is incomplete. That may be why there are so many books out to learn Elements. And why they are so high priced. You are going to need them. I can only think it is part of the game of holding up the Adobe `mystic.' The documentation appears to be designed for those persons who (foolishly) get a sense of accomplishment out of virtually taking on a second job in order to learn to become proficient at a program that should take no more than ten hours of moderate study.  Note that I separate the time to learn the operation of the software from the time it takes to learn to edit photos well.    There are many unnecessary annoyances to the use and operation of this software. Such as not being able to see the full EXIF data on an image from anywhere in the program.  Such as exposure, brightness, contrast, highlights, shadow, fill, recovery, midtone contrast etc., should all be adjustable together, instead of in separate panels which have to be committed to before going on to the other adjustments of the same type. If you don't like the haphazard result, you have to undo many steps and start again. Perhaps some of the many other things I just haven't learned to do yet. But that is just another one of the problems. Things that are not readily apparent in the software, and difficult to find in the masses of incomplete documentation. I would have had to have kept track of the many annoyances from the beginning, and written them down to list them here. Listing them and explaining them would also make this comment much longer than it is. If you are new to thistype of software, and are not already ignoring the deficiencies, you will find out what I am talking about.    Take advantage of the trial downloads. If possible, plan on making the time to use and practice with the software in this 30 day period. Don't be in a hurry to buy one. Use it free. Do the photos you want to do. If necessary, take pictures of anything to practice on as you learn the software. Don't wait for the 30 days to expire before you use the software and decide whether or not you like it. Download the next free trial and do more of your photos.    Edit 6-30-10  I should add that Elements is also capable of some sophisticated editing, such as layers. It also does the cartoon stuff, or perhaps it's art. I suppose which one you get would depend on your initial intent, and your level of skill.    There are also training videos for a monthly subscription fee, or DVD purchase.	2010-06-27

I still buy a copy every once in awhile. I bought this DVD so I could have all of 'em together without dragging all those boxes out of the hall closet. Plus I don't have all the issues so I can see what I've missed over the years. I think the reprodution pretty good. I admit some of the images could be a little sharper, but some are probably scans of the original prints (print shops didn't back up plate images to discs 50 years ago) so therefore the color and register aren't perfect everywhere, but that's kind of authentic because you're seeing the magazine just like you would if you bought it off of a news stand way back when. I would have been nice if they had included a gallery of all those little cartoons they used to put around the borders as they are kind of hard to see on my computer screen without blowing them way up. All in all a good quality product and a must have for MAD fans. Also, it would be nice to see a disc with stuff from all of those MAD paperback books I used to collect. I realize a lot of the content in the paperback was just reprints from the mag, but there's quit a bit of original stuff in them as well.	2008-01-12

So I purchased the key card version because I had heard that the download was a nightmare. But, I have come to find out that the key card is a nightmare too. The 25-character code worked just fine, and making an account was easy, but then came the part where I had to verify that I actually am a student. I tried entering my .edu email address I don't know how many times, only to get the same message that said my email address is not vaild for the University I am attending. That really pissed me off. So I then spent about an hour going between chatting online and actually speaking to someone from microsoft's tech support. They didn't know what they were talking about and were unable to fix my problem.. Now I have a box with a bunch of numbers in it, that I spend $60 on, that I can't even use. Hopefully soon I can get it to work, so I can actually rate the PRODUCT. For now, I'm just an irritated and stressed out college student.	2013-10-30

In this Cyberlink PowerDirector, I think I found one.<br /><br />The process is simple and to the point, Capture, Edit, Produce and Create a Disk. This program was the simplest I've ever was able to capture video without a bunch of hoopla, especially from my Canon VIXTA Mini X. Once captured, editing was easy so far as all I wanted to do was clean up my video of my new grandchildren, edit out the different pauses and rearrange some of the sequences before copying to several disks to share with other family members.<br /><br />Another feature was how easy it was to change the format and how quickly the Rendering process was. You know, isn't the usual long time it takes for a project to render a real deal breaker. This program is three times as fast as the others I've used and own.<br /><br />And because this is the Ultimate version, it came with several add-ons that offer many different approaches to video editing like CyberLinks newest version of WaveEditor 2 for that awesome sound effects, Holiday and Wedding effects and what seems to be an endless array of special effects and adjustments. And although having the ability to view actual 4K is limited and still priced very high, this software has you covered for that also.<br /><br />Am I an expert using CyberLink's newest video editing software, not quite, but so far I am finding it to be the easiest software of this type to master. Along with my new video camera, his software and the several holidays just around the corner, I am looking forward to making some awesome videos., I am looking forward to making some awesome videos.	2014-11-24

Some time ago I tried this product on the 15-day free trial and was completely hooked.  I definitely recommend that you try that first.  There are not many software companies that will allow you to use the full program completely free for that many days.  After purchasing, I loaded TuneUp on three separate computers, of different brands, ages and types (1 two-year old HP desktop, 1 new Dell Laptop, and 1 older HP desktop) with no problems whatsoever.  My computers are running quicker as a result.  The program presents several choices for optimizing your computer speed, and if you are unsure about the effects, you can simply ignore or permanently hide the recommendations.  Also, the choices are reversible.  I am a fairly experienced user and really like the registry cleaner and defragger, which operate quickly with no ill effects, making the program worth it for that alone.  For less experienced users, like one of my friends, the one-click maintenance is plain wonderful, very user friendly.  There is also a three-day default scheduling of optimizing and maintenance that I find very useful as well.<br /><br />May 28, 2014 update:  We have continued to use this program since 2011, buying the updated versions elsewhere because they are not offered at a competitive price on Amazon.  Surprisingly, the best price has been through TuneUp Utilities.  What I particularly like is that older versions are still useable.  For example, that means that if you have more than 3 computers, as we do, you can continue to use the 2013 version on the fourth through sixth computers while using the 2014 version on the main computers.  The other great thing about this program is that when the program takes off what it considers to be useless, irrelevant or otherwise unnecessary software, it has never caused a problem, i.e., taken off something it should not have.	2011-05-24

With the aid of it's onboard decoder, all you have to do is click and drag your mp3 files to a seperate window, and they are automaticaly checked for errors, and converted to WAV format in half the time.  Burning time also seems to be faster, regardless of the speed of your burner.  You can also use the utility to print lables, titles, and even cd cover sheets.  Amazon has a hit on it's hands, for the low price offered.  It makes a great gift for anyone into internet music and entertainment.  I give it a 5 star raiting because it is a time saver, and is relatively easy to get to know.	2001-11-14

Mac Users Beware<br /><br />As others have noted for other versions, Great Game Products has poor customer support and are particularly unresponsive to problems in their Mac version:<br /><br />10 years ago they converted Bridge Baron to OS X.  At the time they had problems with the very useful ability to go the next deal in a library file so they shortsightedly removed it.  10 years and many requests later and they still do not have that function.  One is sent back to the home screen and must navigate to the library file in order to play each successive deal.<br /><br />Compounding this problem, BB used to default to the last directory used when selecting a library file.  Now it defaults to the users root account.<br /><br />Adding to this is BB does not recognize an alias of a library file.<br /><br />The result of this is that because of the hierarchy I use, I have to click 7 times in order to get from one library deal to another - a process that takes 1 click on a PC and used to take only 1 click for Macs.<br /><br />Last year they totally rewrote the PC interface yet they refuse to make minor changes to the Mac version to improve usability.  Shame on them.	2014-12-24

I read the \\"What's New\\" with APE 12, and the enhancements/new features just don't interest me enough. I use Adobe Premiere Elements mainly to edit and publish videos taken by my Sony HDR-AS10 Action Cam, GoPro Hero3 Silver and Hero3+ Black, FujiFilm XP200, and Samsung Galaxy S3 - or any device capable of recording digital video.<br /><br />APE12 and APE11 have the same interface and same workspace, which I actually find easy to work with and not overly complicated. What I don't like are the limited features or confusing settings for color, lighting, etc... The menu system for those settings aren't intuitively organized. In addition, the 3-way color wheel is an effect filter that slows down the rendering significantly, so it makes it slower to see the changes in real-time.<br /><br />The file export settings remain the same with APE12. There's still no presets for 60 frames per second AVCHD footage, which I find surprising given that many \\"HD\\" capable cameras these days will take 1920x1080P at 59.94 fps (60 fps) in the AvCHD format. The Sony Action Cam, GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition, and FujiFilm XP200 all take 60fps 1080P HD footage at varying bitrates. Luckily, I was clicking around one day with APE11 and discovered the \\"Advanced\\" button for the presets that allowed me to make adjustments for resolution, frame rate, bit rate, audio bitrate, and AVCHD profiles (High, Level 4.2, for instance on the GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition). So I was able to create my own presets for the Sony Action Cam (1080P, 60fps, 25 Mbps, Main, Level 4.1) and GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition (1080P, 60fps, 47 Mbps, High, Level 4.2). I used Constant Bit Rate (CBR) with the maximum bitrate I desired, and interestingly enough, APE11/APE12 will not exceed the bitrate of the source file even if I set it abnormally high. For instance, when I used a 35 Mbps file recorded with the GoPro and used my 47 Mbps profile, the output file was still limited at 35 Mbps.<br /><br />I found that using many of the \\"Auto\\" settings for color, lighting, etc.. got me close to the GoPro Studio \\"ProTune\\" setting when working with video files recorded using the ProTune mode. I also had to turn down the gamma correction a bit more to match it.<br /><br />Would I recommend Adobe Premiere Elements? Absolutely, if you're a beginner or intermediate in video editing. Some may recommend the competing Sony editing software, but personally I found APE11/APE12 easy enough to jump right in and learn the interface within a day or two. I am able to create some high quality videos to upload to YouTube and playback in 1080P HD format. Let's face it, most of our \\"masterpieces\\" (in-car / motorcycle on-board footage or sports shots) end up being played on laptops or smartphones/tablets on YouTube. For the professional photographer and videographer, you wouldn't be considering APE11 or APE12 in the first place.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars. Not many changes from Adobe Premiere Elements 11, still lacks presets for 1080P 60fps output files in AVCHD format but it is easy enough to create your own custom profile with the correct bitrate, etc...

That allowed you make a \\"forensic\\" quality backup of a hard drive to CD-R, DVD-R, a ghost image on another drive, or a disk-to-disk backup.  It even let you change the partition sizes during a restore.  In Ghost 10.0, you no longer have a standalone backup capability. <br /> <br />I purchased Ghost 10.0 so I could back up a Linux system.  Symantec's literature claims that you can back up Linux ext2 and ext3 file systems using Ghost.  When I discovered that you cannot do this without first installing Windows, I called customer support.  By the way, you have to have a Visa card in hand to talk to someone in customer support.  They confirmed that the only way to back up a Linux system is to install Windows, then install Ghost inside of Windows.  Duh!  Oh, and Ghost 10.0 only runs on Windows XP and 2000. <br /> <br />Why not provide backup capability from the bootable CD-ROM?  It appears to me that the purpose of forcing you to install the product in Windows is so they can enforce their Product Key licensing scheme.  You can only use the product key on a single Windows installation.  Once you use the key, you cannot reinstall it on another system.  If you don't activate the product, you can't do backups.  It appears to me that Symantec spent more time and effort on anti-piracy than they spent on improving the product.  In my opinion, they removed the most useful feature in Ghost, bar none, when they took away the ability to create a bootable floppy allowing you to run standalone backup. <br /> <br />I will never buy another Symantec product in my life.  In fact, I plan to actively discourage others from doing so. <br />	2006-12-11

This OS is so bad I just want to stick my PC in a fiery furnace. I hate it with all that's in me. It's so bad that I had to google how to shut the computer down..  That's so sad...<br /><br />This OS is NOT made for a desktop PC, it's made for a tablet, so you have to use your mouse as if it where a finger. This may seem like the best idea since sliced bread, but in practice it fails. They placed pop out bars all over the edge of the screen. Everything is positioned as if my desktop is a tablet. Half the time I don't know where to put my mouse curser to get the side bar to pop out. I guess if I had a 24in touchscreen monitor I could use my finger.<br /><br />This nonsense of Microsoft trying to push ahead of Apple/Google in all three tech areas (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) with one OS is kind of like Caligula's War on Poseidon. Sure, in theory you could march your entire army (putting all your eggs in one basket with one OS) to the shore and have them throw their spears in to the water, but in practice all you end up with are a bunch of confused and very upset soldiers (the customers). If I want a tablet, I'll buy a tablet, give me my desktop back.<br /><br />I guess the CEO of MS and Caligula have some things in common. He can't lead,he makes horrible decisions, he'll be remembered as one of the worst CEOs in the history of MS, and he's completely crazy.<br /><br />DON'T buy this, it will make you sick.	2013-07-24

It provides you with an introduction to the basic and more advanced concepts of business intelligence and discusses the architectures of possible solutions. The content of the course is divided into two main sections. The first section takes a closer look at general principles and explains why business intelligence is necessary from the point of view of top management. Possible solutions are also discussed. Due to the complexity of the subject matter, this section focuses on the basic principles of business intelligence itself and not on how it interacts with related areas. The second section takes a more detailed look at the concepts discussed in the first section. Specific aspects of design and architecture are considered and possible Business Information Warehouse solutions presented. This section also explains the fundamental difference between the Data Warehouse and ERP systems and looks at a number of characteristic features (procedures, project planning, roles, and so on) of Business Information Warehouse projects. <br /> <br />Learn To <br /> <br />* Strategic Enterprise Management. <br /> <br />* Case for Action. <br /> <br />* Categorization/Keywords. <br /> <br />* Top-Level Application Architecture. <br /> <br />* Key Figures. <br /> <br />* Scope of BI. <br /> <br />* Business Information Warehousing. <br /> <br />* Business Information Warehouse Design. <br /> <br />* Business Information Warehouse Architecture. <br /> <br />* Use of Balanced Scorecards. <br /> <br />* BIW Project. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Audience <br /> <br />The following audiences are targeted: Top management; Middle management (in particular, decision makers).

I realize I am still on a learning curve, but there are some areas which I feel could be improved to make it much easier to load in your stamp collection.  For instance, a way to toggle on and off certain fields to lock in repetitive information so that you don't have to key in this information over and over.  It would also be nice if the software could remember where you last entered information rather the starting from the beginning every time.  Maybe I'm being too simplistic, but it would be nice to enter all your information and then hit the enter key rather then looking for the blue check mark.  One more minor irritation, I prefer dates to be month, day and year, not year, month and day.  All-in-all I like the program and it seems to have everything anyone would want....just needs a little tweeking in my opinion..	2014-11-10

I've always loved this program,.  It was always simple to use  I purchased printshop 2.0 about two months ago.  It took a little getting used to the new interface it is a faster.  But speed is not always everything.  With that said!  They strip this software down to the bone.  Label selection is practically non-existent.  Why bother?  Personally I would just keep printshop 23 and save the money you were going to spend on an upgrade.  Yes it may be a slower interface but it's a familiar one and you can still use all your older projects from previous versions.  My advice whenever you rebuild a program from the ground up I think the smart thing to do is to at least include a program that will help convert your old projects to the new software format.  Please note I have nothing against making software better.  I am all for improvement.  But in doing so I think you should take into consideration the people who have been loyal users of the printshop product and how they may react to such a drastic change.  Most people that have use this product over the years have spent countless hours on a lot of their projects and will be leery about future purchases of the printshop brand.  I mean why spend time on ideas that you may have to start all over again.  Software and computers are supposed to make life easier not add frustration.	2010-05-27

The thing is that this is the best there is and the best just is not very good yet.  There are just too many variables. They really need to warn people when they buy because this is expensive stuff.  I want a  refund.  We should not have to rely on the word of others but on the company itself.  They are not being honest enough.  They should say this is still primitive and hard to use and prone to errors.  It is just barely usable at best.  It takes a ton of work to make it better and better is still not good.  I bought this on a hope and a dream and was shot down by that, being all I was standing on.  The problem is that they still have my money.  It is not fair but that it is the way it is.

Nice features, easy to use.  After a few days of daily incremental backups, it started hanging near the end of the backup process.  99% done, 3 seconds to go.... Had to kill the process to make it go away.  I'm assuming that once that started happening, the backup files created from that point on were incomplete/corrupt, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br />I tried to do a restore with the initial \\"disaster recovery compliant full backup\\".  It wouldn't recognize my USB drive as a place to look for the backup file.  It said it would have done the restore TO my USB drive, but it wasn't in the list of places to restore FROM.  Restoring TO a USB drive would be pretty useless since you don't boot up from an external drive, and wanting to restore FROM a USB drive is a pretty obvious good thing to be able to do...  That is, after all, where I had put all my full and incremental backup files.  It will only restore from an internal hard drive or a CD/DVD as nearly as I could tell.  Unfortunately my laptop doesn't have a 2nd hard drive on which to put the backup files, and it's pretty hard to do automatic backup of a 40GB save set onto CD/DVD.  (I didn't feel like getting up at 03:00 Saturday mornings to babysit the weekly full backup and swap blank DVDs for it... And I wasn't too keen on burning 10 DVDs/week for backup either.  That's why I bought a USB drive...)  So I still don't know if the restore function works. <br /> <br />I tried contacting support by email and by phone to ask about these 2 issues.  I was on hold on the phone (on a non-800 number call) for about 15 minutes when I gave up and left a message.  Neither email nor phone messages were ever responded to.   <br /> <br />Save yourself the time.  Don't even bother downloading the trial version.  It will cost you time and won't get you any further in your quest to find a backup solution.	2006-05-13

I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.  For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.<br />But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the \\"download warranty\\" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all.<br />The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down?<br />Next issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called \\"Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse\\".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?  And was it real, or did Norton make it up to justify the money I spent?  Based on the other issues mentioned above, I can't really trust them.<br />My advice: avoid Norton like the plague.	2003-09-25

I bought Partition Commander 10 Professional a couple years ago, installed & registered it, and it worked fine.  I never installed it anywhere else, and hadn't actually needed it again until recently.<br /><br />  One of my partitions was getting full, so I tried to reallocate space using PC10, but when I hit \\"Apply\\" I was given a pop-up saying that my registration key was no longer valid...  So after hunting down Avanquest's Tech support line (716.616.4901) I was told by the tech guy that they simply NO LONGER SUPPORT THAT PRODUCT, but that I could buy Partition Commander 11..!<br /><br />  I tried appealing again, stating that I bought the software from a legitimate source (Fry's Electronics), still had the original disk (and box), and had never installed it anywhere else, but that suddenly Partition Commander has stopped working.  However, every question of mine was replied with \\"I'm sorry sir, but we no longer support that version of the software\\" !!!<br /><br />  It made me seriously wonder if Avanquest software was pre-programmed to stop working after a certain amount of time so that you are forced to upgrade (they've certainly flooded my Inbox over the past couple years with various product offers)!<br /><br />  I will NEVER buy another Avanquest product after this, and I would seriously caution anyone else from doing the same.

You can not update the construction data with out manually searching MS's web site for the file then downloading it and copying it into the Streets and Trips directory.  The message I got from MS support was that this was a problem in the software that was 'hard coded' (their words) and so when trying to update construction info you get a message that says 'can't find the update server' - evidently they moved the location of the update file and neglected to update the  software.  I would recommend holding off on purchasing this product until a) MS has an update, or b) the next version is released - hopefully without the broken feature.	2003-01-29

I bought the software when I was required to go on a low cholesterol diet.  I had no idea how much cholesterol was in the different foods I ate.  The first problem that I encountered was that most of the time, I had to enter products with all the information off the package into DietMaster.  I would have expected a larger database of products and sizing choices.  The second problem is the main issue.  I had to remove DietMaster from my computer.  It continued to cause my computer to freeze up,give error messages and close down.  My computer is new (less than 4 months old) with Windows 7 and has a dual core processor and tons of memory.

That was before Google Maps or MapQuest, when a program of this sort was a great improvement over paper maps.  Now, however, software such as Microsoft Streets and Trips must be compared to Google Maps, the premier mapping application, which of course is free.  To be worth paying money for a mapping program (both for the initial purchase and yearly updates), it must offer substantially more functionality than Google Maps, and that is a serious challenge.<br />Unfortunately, Streets and Trips doesn't make the grade.  Compared to Google Maps, the maps are less customizable - there is no way to view terrain, for example.  The labels on the maps (street names, city names, etc.) are less readable, in a rather jaggy font.  There is a good deal less detail in closeup views of cities - for example, when zooming in to City Hall, New York, NY, in Google maps you can see the building outlines, and the names of numerous government offices and businesses.  In Streets and Trips, there are no building outlines, and far fewer labels.  Clicking on a label in Google Maps gives you the address, phone number, and Website of the place, a street view, plus links for getting directions, searching nearby, saving to a map, and more.  Clicking on a label in Streets and Trips just gives you the address and phone number.<br />Streets and Trips is also less capable than Google Maps for searches outside the U.S.  For example, when I searched for Cornwall, UK in Google Maps it opened up to a map of that part of the UK; in Streets and Trips it didn't recognize Cornwall, and suggested Cornhill, Scotland.  In the Google Maps view of Cornwall, I can zoom right down to street level; in the Streets and Trips view (after locating Cornwall manually), zoom only goes about halfway, so no fine detail is visible.<br />All in all, programs like Streets and Trips have had their day, and it is over now.	2011-07-28

Couldn't live with such a backwards design.	I suppose I must start this review with my experience and knowledge with computers so you can see where I might be coming from. I've been using computers strongly since Windows 3.1, and all exclusively Windows. I have had some experience in programming and designing programs, but in the last decade I have studied more design and user interface. As late of 2012, I worked for MS through a contractor for about a year and was very enthusiastic about some of the products coming out. I build my own computer systems, budgets are always an issue, and I use a lot of programs that are not on Mac so that's why I've stayed PC-exclusive. I enjoy when a company understands function coupled with aesthetics. I think Google and Garmin are great examples of this (although for my fellow Android fans, I must exclude Android from that list, as it excels in function, and lacks in aesthetics. I recently had a Windows Phone, but switched to Android, so if it's hate for Android, it's a bit of self-hate here too lol).<br /><br />Ok, I hope that paints a small picture.<br /><br />The big Windows change:<br />I don't mind the idea of changing Windows so drastically. I enjoy the idea of risk / reward when done right. I am not on the bandwagon of those that complain about why they changed Windows in the first place (just for the sake of change). I like how they tried to make it more similar to the Windows Phone platform, and how they experimented with transforming it into something we haven't seen before. Unfortunately, everything looks good only on the surface (pun intended). When you dive into the settings, everything is counter-intuitive - not just because it's different, but because it just doesn't make sense in how they did things. I believe they have gone backwards in the functionality of the design of the UI. For example, in Windows 7, it took less clicks or actions to turn off your computer than it did in Vista - naturally. It takes about 2 actions in Vista's successor, Windows 7. In Windows 8 though, you have to pull up bottom right corner, click Settings, click Power options, click Shut down. Really? Why so many more actions than Windows 7? They say it's because they want your computer to be in an always-on situation, so it's a design &#34;feature&#34;. I have an HTPC and it will likely be on all the time... but why do they want to pigeon-hole users to use it the way THEY want you to? I know it sounds like I'm complaining about just shutting down the computer, but I'm not. I will be having my computer on all the time anyway so it doesn't really affect me that much.The other issue with this always-on thing is that this Windows is not as stable as they want you to believe - I've had so much &#34;glitching&#34; of the &#34;start screen&#34; requiring reboots (where I can't even see the reboot options to reboot in the first place) that it's not even funny. They can't tell me they want to keep my computer on all the time, and when it IS on all the time, it glitches up like that. This computer shutdown situation is just one example of how backwards they have gone that can be explained somewhat easily without having to require someone the horror of actually experiencing it for themselves.<br /><br />Live Tiles and Start Screen:<br />While there were some welcome changes like Live Tiles, faster boot times and search features (the last one was almost a con; try finding a program you installed and see how quickly you start to cuss MS out), they just are not worth it. I loved Live Tiles on my Windows Phone. I hate them on Windows 8. The colors of some of the tiles were unbearable, as well as the pre-chosen backgrounds - which is obnoxious because they don't want users to &#34;customize&#34; their PC to their liking - they have to control that too apparently. On an HTPC, it became almost impossible to read what some of the live tiles said, so the tiles / start screen was of no use for me even on the &#34;large&#34; settings. When going to the &#34;large&#34;tile size settings, the tiles would take up all the space, making the start screen as a one-stop shop for information impossible because you would end up having to scroll for what seemed to be miles to find something. Then in that setting, the text would take up most of the space in the tiles, not really showing you anything of value. Speaking of scrolling, it felt so archaic how jarring the scrolling was instead of smooth scrolling. Ugh. The Start Screen mixed with the limitations of Live Tiles settings and backgrounds just made it feel so constrained - as if they wanted to control the way you experienced your own computer. Just terrible.<br /><br />The wonderful 8.1 Upgrade:<br />Yeah... you might as well format your hard drive because you can kiss every single Windows setting you ever had GOODBYE. It's that intrusive, and what's worse is that they don't even warn you before you update. You might think it's like a service update or something, but nope. I was waiting patiently for it for months hoping it would make things much better, and installed it on the first day they released it. Boy was I mistaken. Having an HTPC, I had to spend literally dozens of hours to tweak a lot of settings in order to be able to view and enjoy my PC from a big screen the way I wanted to. Yeah, I lost all my settings. Text size settings, video card settings, color settings, resolution, Windows Media Center settings.... not to mention all the other programs I had installed that I had to reconfigure. I had to redo so many things it was just an absolute nightmare. That was about the last straw for me, I gave up on W8 a couple of months after that update.<br /><br />About Microsoft:<br />There are some people that should never have jobs in the technology industry again after this installment of Windows. There's absolutely no way any professional designer with a conscience and good work ethic would have let this go out the door this way without hanging up their careers and go become farmers or something out of guilt and shame.<br /><br />I have seriously considered Linux for the first time in my life because of this installation of Windows. It's that horribly designed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the fact that I have 3TB full of media (so I can't reformat for Linux) and simply want a simpler PC experience rather than a more complex one, I will have to do like most people and cut my losses, go back to Windows 7 and wait for the next installation of Windows - and hope that the next team building it will have a shred of competency, decency and integrity and that the people who were responsible for designing Windows 8 will be living off the land somewhere in the wilderness. Fat chance, but I suppose I can dream. There's a reason why there's been so much restructuring and change of leadership, back peddling, double speak, murmurs of regret and them trying to fix the horror they are living at MS lately....<br />These people are clowns, and this installation of Windows has been a fiasco that will go down in history in a much worse light than Windows ME or Vista ever did. Windows ME and Vista will look like success in comparison. Change Windows 9 all up, I don't care. JUST MAKE IT WORK.	2014-03-14

As a customer expecting from a software title as this I think it should or at least they should clearly put it in its features that says it does not convert secured PDF files if it can't. I had a few PDF files that are secured and does not allow copying any portion of their contents. I hoped a converter could convert them so I could copy a paragraph/page or two. This convert opened the file without any problem. However, when I tried to convert the secured PDF to any format I was asked to put in permission password to open the secured PDF file (maybe in a different way). If I have the permission password from the original secured PDF file creater would I need this converter for this purpose? Since it has already opened the secured PDF file why can't it do converting based on that?     Their support sucks. For $100 price tag their support has to be much much better.    1 star rating is based mainly on the two aspects I mentioned above.	2009-02-10

The program failed to open.  I typed the error message into a search engine and found a link to an Intuit support article for the previous Quickbooks 2011 version. It detailed a procedure for correction.  It had me bring up the Windows task manager and kill the Quickbooks process.  After doing that I was then able to open Quickbooks and gain access to Preferences.  I unchecked \\"Start Quickbooks at Startup\\".  After that the program has worked fine.  I have deducted one star for this problem because it is something Intuit knew about from the last Quickbooks version and it is still a problem.

The reliability has improved significantly during the last few years but it still seems Intuit releases software with significant problems.	2011-11-02

But don't try to learn how to use FCE on your own - buy a book such as Final Cut Express for Dummies and spend some time working through the concepts. I had previously used Adobe Premiere, so making the switch to FCE was not quite the hurdle that is going to be for others. If you make the jump from iMovie, do realize you will need to spend a lot of time learning how to use FCE.<br /><br />If you are going to edit simple home movies, probably stick with iMovie. iMovie is quick and simple. But for professional results, definitely use FCE. But do realize there is a fairly steep learning curve. Once mastered, editing in FCE is quick.<br /><br />I use FCE for professional quality editing work when I need to edit down multiple cameras shooting simultaneously  (a feature that Final Cut Pro now makes automatic, but not FCE), and complex editing involving numerous audio and video tracks. I routinely re-arrange my audio from one clip and overlay over another. I also routinely adjust audio levels and mix multiple audio tracks. While FCE HD comes with the Soundtrack application, most of my audio editing is done with the FCE audio tools directly. LiveType is a titling application that also is bundled with FCE HD and enables the creation of broadcast quality titling and titling effects. LiveType is worth the price of FCE HD alone! FCE also includes a huge assortment of both audio and video filters to adjust or clean up original content, or color filters to match the colors between multiple cameras.<br /><br />Except for simple home movies, where I still sometimes use iMovie, I use FCE HD for everything else. I could not produce the type of material that I create without FCE HD. I strongly recommend FCE for anyone wishing to produce professional quality video results, especially those who need to synchronize and mix multiple video and audio tracks and/or use advanced titling features of LiveType.<br /><br />Like most video applications, more RAM is better. FCE sort of runs on my 640 MB RAM Powerbook G4. But it flies on the my dual 867 Mhz G4 with 2 GB of RAM (but 1 GB would be plenty). If you are going to be doing video editing, a GB of RAM will be very desirable.640 MB RAM Powerbook G4. But it flies on the my dual 867 Mhz G4 with 2 GB of RAM (but 1 GB would be plenty).

Beyond the customizable rides you also have pre-built rides that you add to your park. Your park goers provide feedback on your rides and such. They might puke if your ride is built with too many g-forces and such or cheer if they love your ride.	2011-08-08

In my excitment, I didn't read the changes before I installed, so imagine my surprise.    I find Word and Excel the most difficult to adjust, Outlook (which I barely used in the past or now) and Access seem almost the same, well different, but no more difficult or easier, and Powerpoint and publisher seem like they may be more user friendly.    I normally go out of pocket to upgrade my office ever 3-5 years, and the last version I bought was 2002, but I continued to use 2000 because publisher wasn't compatible with many of my business associates.  I have gotten very used to MS being consistent for so long, that had I not recived this as a gift, I would have evaluated other office productivity software before making a purchase with my own money.  I wonders if any significant number of people will do so.	2007-06-15

The reason I began looking for antivirus software was I was tired of Norton Antivirus slowing down my computer and taking lots of system resources. I'm always suspicious of customers reviews so I try to go through at least two different sites and read professional reviews as well - I tend to think software companies pay people to write good reviews on their products and bad ones against the competition.    Since Kaspersky seemed to meet my criteria on that subject I decided to give it a try. I did notice one or two reviewers here who got their systems completely messed up by Kaspersky but I thought they either didn't know what they were doing or were just hired reviewers.    Right after uninstalling Norton (yes, I did uninstall it completely, folders, registry keys and all) and installing Kaspersky the problems began: first, closed programs would stay in memory. Then I couldn't run certain programs (microsoft built-in disk defragmenter being one of them) - they showed up in memory according to task manager, but wouldn't execute. I tried to restart the computer, but Windows wouldn't even shut down so I had to shut it down manually (using the reset button).    Next the operating system (Windows XP) wouldn't even display the logon screen, so I had to reboot in safe mode. Surprise, surprise, the windows installer won't run in safe mode. So I basically had to uninstall the program manually - files, registry keys, etc. - this is a *lot* trickier than it seems, and believe me, most users would be forced to format their hard disk. Kaspersky grabs lots of drivers, installs a hidden monitoring agent for its own files and service and replaces the entry points of some essential services and drivers.    Long story short, a week after I installed (and uninstalled) Kaspersky, I'm still struggling with my computer's configuration in order to get it back the way it was before. I've spent many hours which were just plain lost because of this piece of software. I don't have words to describe how upset I am with this product and its manufacturer, and I obviously won't ever install anything from them again. To top it off, they say on the website there's a 14 day money back guarantee, \\"no questions asked\\", on which I now depend because I was confident enough not to download the 30-day trial version before buying it.    Anyway lesson learned, I am now evaluating a different product called NOD32 which is supposedly for the more tech-savvy, however I didn't think it was that complicated to set up (unless you want to play with its configuration). It's a lot faster than Norton and didn't cause any weird behavior so far, I'll probably end up buying it. Now, if you're happy with Norton, don't try to upgrade to Kaspersky: it's simply not worth the risk.	2007-08-19

The reason I recommend this CD is the practice tests and the vocabulary builder. When I took the GRE the first time I had reviewed my math and practiced my vocab, but I was not used to doing the problems in a strict time limited environment. This CD has practice tests that mock the real GRE, so you can get used to working under a time limit, and answering the questions on a computer. The vocabulary builder was a real help too. It is a game where you try to match the words with their definitions in a limited amount of time. The only problem I have with this software is it comes off alittle cheesy and childish when you do some of the lessons. Other than that, its worth using.	2005-11-24

But I've used digital photography for years, and have experience with Photoshop and Corel programs. Manga Studio seemed to be just the thing I'd want for noodling around with a digitizing tablet, making small illustrations and a comic or two.<br /><br />It's great for that. I love just sitting down with my laptop and sketching, or mindlessly letting my pen wander around creating doodles and drawings. But what really has me delighted is how powerful the program is! This is one of the best creative programs I've ever used - easy and intuitive for the basic functions and not too steep a learning curve for more advanced tools. How awesome it would have been to have had this when I was still in school in the 70's!<br /><br />In addition to the program itself, there are lots of helpful resources for Manga Studio available on the web. SmithMicro's website has all the manuals you'll need as well as links to tutorial videos and a wide-ranging help forum. There are individual artists who use MS and distribute customized tools which easily plug in to MS. And of course, there are books available (one caveat: do NOT buy Manga Studio for Dummies if you are buying Manga Studio 5 or 5EX - that book was written for an older MS version and will be no help at all to you.)<br /><br />I would recommend this program for anyone who likes to draw, paint, or create - whether it's for a kid in school studying art, or for an old fart like me wanting to open a new creative avenue.	2014-10-23

The complexity, footprint and ridiculous accumulation of redundant and/or useles featires is mind boggling. It's not particularly stable either and the performance can best be described as leisurely. To add to the festivities the CinemaNow 'feature' is nothing but a trojan horse to get you to subscribe to use Roxio's movie service - it needs Media Player 11 and caused an error msg to pop up repeatedly upon installation and the mandatory reboot (another absurd and obsolete requirement). Make sure you diable the cinemanow service or your PC is basically rendered useless unless everything in the house of cards that is Media Player 11 / Roxio is perfectly aligned. You can download whatever you need from zdnet (or amazon, natch ...) for about $19 - $29 (always free to try) - these little apps put together will do whatever this monster does, more quickly and cleanly.

The tech support people I talked with blame the IRS for the hold up.   I don't know whose problem it is, though my research and my suspicions tend to make me blame  Intuit. I feel that Intuit's bungling with the DRM situation and the well documented failures of this years product are good enough reasons to stay away for good.

As a college student, I was a little worried about dropping $60.00 (bagatrix offers a discount if you order Algebra 1 and 2 together) on software package I wasn't really too sure about. I'm struggling in Algebra 1 mostly due to time concerns, which means I have to learn at a fury pace. I work full-time (and then some) and go to school full time, I just moved and I've had a lot going on. I was falling behind rapidly and steadily moving down the grade ladder (which wasn't acceptable for a student who's been carrying a 3.9 GPA for the last year). I was willing to roll the dice, and I'm glad I did!     I just started with this software, but by watching the problem at hand get solved, I'm learning a great deal easier (text books tend to give you an easy problem to learn off of, and then give you a hard problem to solve, resulting in a lot of reverse-engineering a solution out of a problem that doesn't translate across that well). So far, I'm looking forward to saving my GPA and doing some constructive learning at a little less frantic pace. Also, this program shows it's work, allowing a person to know how the solution came about. It doesn't always mesh up with the textbook I'm using as far as the methods to get the results, but I've checked the results, and the answers match.    Great program, easy to use, install took about ten minutes (and I'm running an old AMD Athlon 1800+ w/ 512MB of standard DDR).	2007-10-15

What I did:  got an OEM copy of the software (it's like XP Media Center - MS doesn't want to sell these without hardware) and bought a PC off of UBID - a refurbished unit with the specs to handle this OS.  Because the experience is designed to be hassle-free out of the box, MS isn't encouraging do-it-yourselfers to get the product at retail.  And yet, I wanted my own machine to save money and to play with the install to see how it went.    In a word, (almost) flawless.  I got the ubid pc with windows home basic on it, and popped in the WHS DVD. It installed with minimal input from me, and booted right up.    There was one error message, because I was using a do-it-yourself machine, I needed to install the network drivers for my particular box.  The error message and troubleshooting guide led me directly to the problem.  Because this is Windows at its core, I went to the internet and downloaded an old XP driver for my network card, and it installed without a problem.  I was a little bit worried that there would be a compatibility issue, but it has worked flawlessly since I installed the net driver.    Bottom line: this unit is great.  It works completely as advertised, and I'm anxious to set this box up as an iTunes server, a media server for WMAs, a repository for recorded media center TV shows, and because this is a windows box at its core, it won't be long before someone ports a torrent client over to this box and has it trickling content 24-7.    The machine I used has 512k, a 1.7 amd chip, and a couple of hard drives. Any old tower case will have enough drive bays for expansion, and this one has plenty.  I can fit 4 or 5 more drives in there as I need them, and the whole hardware setup cost about $340 for 650 gig of redundant storage.    Great work, Microsoft.  Now get out there and tell people about this product.	2007-11-14

I was happy with Windows 98 but then someone stole our computer.  The replacement came with Windows XP motto \\"we think you want things this way, so don't try to do what you want, we know best\\".  If you're a newby you might be happy with this approach, but XP has sucked up hours of time trying to be whipped into line so that it does what I want, in the way that I want it.<br />For example: <BR>- it's incompatible with ZoneAlarm firewall.  Every time Windows updates, Outlook Express permissions on ZoneAlarm have to be reconfigured or you don't get email.  98 didn't have this problem.<BR>- useful programs that I use on my Start Menu disappear if I don't use them.  So items used (say) monthly have to be hunted down, requiring more mouse clicks. This is an irritating functionality.<BR>- the Help function is crippled by comparison to 98, unless you are willing to go onto the internet.  With phone-line dial-in, this is irritating.<BR>- there is little guidance on setting up Identities for a new user of identities, and some programs will register and operate under some identities but not under others (unless you buy two copies of the program).  This means more mouse clicks, or duplicate configuration.<BR>- it assumes you want all of microsoft's products to operate for you.  In truth I want Word and Excel to never ever go on the internet, and I never want HTML or Word files to be my basic email mode. <BR>- it assumes that only Windows Media Player is the soundware of choice.<BR>- it takes a long time to close down, to the point where you assume it has failed to shut down. Advice: don't CTRL ALT DEL.  Just wait even longer.<br />Those are the negatives.  In sum, XP behaves like a giant bundled amorphous mass, and trying to configure to prevent certain chunks from behaving in an aggressive fashion will take you much time and effort.<br />However it is relatively stable compared with Windows 98, and most of the configuration can be achieved in time. <br />On thesegrounds, and given that 98 is no longer supported, it can be recommended. <br />Martin	2003-04-13

Imagine taking a phone order for a big job and just clicking one package to invoice, purchase and create a workorder to get all of the paperwork done.<br /><br />QuickBooks will really help you save time running your business if you spend a little time up front or hire someone to get it all set up correctly from the beginning.	2011-02-09

I am the type of person to understand and learn I need to see and hear which this does very well.  You can go at your own pace, keep repeating as much as you like.  The format is easy to get through.  I like that it does give sentences that you will use, explination of nouns, pronouns, adjitives etc.  If you never have tried a second language and are just starting to learn, this will be good to start with.

I actually did some damage to my registry pressing the wrong buttons at the wrong time (without any final warnings from the software) before I knew to avoid certain things. Afterwards it became clear this is a very crude and clunky program. The only \\"fix\\" to every problem is delete the registry entry. After about a week I finally stopped trying to use it. Now I'm getting notices that they want me to pay for this software all over again! I don't know if they are trying to force an upgrade or what but I tried to tell them I already paid for it a long time ago and this is NOT like anti-virus software (or the like) that needs to be kept up to date. They just write back saying I have an \\"evaluation version\\" even when I send them proof! I told them this program was removed from my PC a long time ago.

We worked so hard with him to get  there. and guess what ... pooh has mixed things up and it wasn't eeore's birthday afterall ( so no candles no cake )but any day spent with friends is a party!!!! my son was crieing and begging me to put a cake and candles there! It was total dissapointment.  I also didn't like that piglets pictures had to be colored how piglet wanted them to be. (this was the only thing he could do without my help but the colors were different so I had to change them to the &quot;proper&quot; ones to be able to  paint the next picture)  kanga's alphabet soup was fun - we liked it a lot.   tigers music machine was also lots of fun  Owls house little boring-my son showed no interest.

Now it imports last year's TurboTax data!<br />The Bad: Now I know why it's cheaper. TaxCut is a mere advertisement for H&R Block. The program does its best to confuse the user into giving up and driving to the local office for human filing help. TaxCut's web-based \\"Help\\" system will run you around in aimless circles. The so-called automatic update asks for permission to connect to the Internet, even though that's how the Help works the entire time. If it finds an update, the program claims that it will handle everything. Not true, it simply dumps you on their web site where it doesn't even show you which files you should download and manually install. Skipped an interview question accidentally? Don't try the Back button, because half the time it will skip back an entire section instead of that last page. You get to start over! What about that one year head-start in OS X? I guess it wasn't long enough to pop the lid on Cocoa so we could use a mouse with a scroll wheel.<br />The Ugly (as of April 13): Pop-up menus in the interview questions look empty until you pop them open. After you make a selection, it doesn't show anymore, as the size goes back to zero. After you complete a section (i.e. 1099-MISC worksheet) and come back to its directory, sometimes the item you just created will display and sometimes it won't. And I hope you didn't change your mind about that single item you decided to add in an Itemize list yesterday. When you open your file today, the entire list you created will now be titled \\"untitled\\" and contain one item called \\"value.\\"<br />The Fugly: TurboTax import? All seemed well until I got to the final error check. \\"You have 270 errors and 4 warnings.\\" Why? Because I suddenly had 69 depreciation lists, only three of which were legit. All 270 errors stem from a logical error taught in programming 101: Anywhere I'd entered a \\"No\\" or zero in TurboTax was now a blank in TaxCut, and it thinks I haven't answered questions about whether I've sold an item or not, or to which copy of the Schedule C this should be applied. There wasn't even a way to mass-delete all the extra forms. I had to visit each form to delete it. When I got to the vehicle expense section, my vehicle from the previous years didn't show up. I guess it didn't import. Wait! Yes it did, because now I'm getting errors for each one, also because of one or two \\"missing\\" choices. Waste more time repairing, and.. No errors, no warnings, proceed to state.. Three warnings. Visit the first warning. An incomplete description, circular Help, and a suggestion to modify the \\"form below.\\" There is no form below. That's enough.<br />The numerous and pathetic bugs in TaxCut would be acceptable in other types of software. But this is a program with a deadline, written by people who are supposed to be good at details (if nothing else). I'm left feeling unsure about my personal taxes for the first time in several years of MacInTax aka TurboTax Mac.

The nightmare starts with no start button. It took me hours and much searching on the internet to figure out how to find wordpad just so I could write a letter. I then saved it to my desktop so I could find it again. I would suggest that before you purchase that you try it anyway you can - test it in front of someone familiar with it. It reminds me of fixing something that isn't broken. That usually means lots of job security. Sometimes you just want to know what time it is, not how the watch works.	2012-11-28

I have developed a liking for Vegas movie studio as well but it seems as though Pinnacle's workflow is still my favorite for speedy production from a logical workflow.  Color correction has also improved in that it is no longer grainy.  With Pan and zoom, PIP, chromakeying and an overlay track, one has plenty of room to grow into this software as well.  If you like the logic behind the workflow, but want more, try diving into Liquid Edition 6.  There will be a learning curve but it is rock solid and you may never use another NLE package again.  BEWARE... Be prepared to learn.  Back to studio, I too came across some problems in the past with rendering hangups on Studio 8.  After much frustration, my problem was resolved by leaving a little leeway at the beginning and end of my imaginate avi.s.  I've researched alot on video editing practices in the past year and here's a couple of tips for those having problems.   <br />     1) Absolutely, positively keep video files on a separate drive from the operating system and software.   <br />     2) Let the software complete a task before moving on to another edit.   <br />     3) Work on projects in sections and either copy and paste them together when ready to render or preferably create separate avi.s and piece them together.  This IS how even the pros do it.   <br />     4)  Put in effects last after editing your clips.  Chances of project becoming corrupt decrease greatly.  And all NLE packages are susceptible to corrupt projects. <br /> <br />Best of luck and happy editing.	2005-02-08

Encarta's interface has for years been much better than Britannica's, but this year's edition (2004) is different.

And there is no way to turn this monstrous thing off!<br />So, if you already have a not too old copy of Encarta on your computer, and you are not a caroussel maniac or a two or three years old child, better SKIP 2004 CAROUSSEL EDITION of Encarta and WAIT FOR A NORMAL EDITION.	2003-09-19

The church I started to attend uses the NIV which isn't included in this software. I bought this software with the intentions of learning more about the bible and, most important for a beginner, picking a bible that's right for me. This software is only good if you want to see translations of bibles not significantly used, if at all, today. There was an interesting section called Chronology of Biblical Christainity which itself is interesting, but to the beginner it was quite overwhelming. It would have been more comprehendible if it had been sectioned off into denominations. (Ex. the history of Lutheranism (sp?), Calvinism, Methodism, etc). It wasn't a bad feature though. There is also a link where you can &quot;Upgrade&quot; to a better version. The upgraded version I believe includes the NRSV, NASB, NKJ, and NAB-with Apocrypha along with a few other features. It seems to me that this version was to get me to buy it so I could spend another $40 and upgrade to the translations in use today. Although it did list on the product before I bought it what versions were included; a beginner isn't going to know that the KJV or the ASV, aren't too popular these days. I already have the NKJ version so if I upgraded it would only be for the NRSV, NASB and NAB. My recommendations to the manufacturer is to include the most used versions today and not require us to upgrade to get them. I probably won't upgrade simply because I don't want to spend more money.	2003-11-29

Clients will need to be added, and scripts will need to be scheduled anew with version 8.1.\\"    This is so disappointing! An industrial strength backup solution NEEDS to be backwards compatible. Now I need to keep two versions of Retrospect on my machine. And as we finish migrating to Intel Macs I'll have to keep a PowerPC around just in case I need to recover something from the 6.x archives. Ridiculous!    And again I quote from the Read Me \\"Retrospect 8.1 performs slowly on PowerPC-based Macs. For the best performance, EMC strongly recommends that users upgrade their Retrospect servers to Intel-based Macs. For those who cannot upgrade at this time, EMC software engineers are continuing to improve Retrospect 8's performance on all processor types, and performance boosts are likely in a future release.\\"    This is a little worrisome to me, how slow is slowly? More slowly than it runs on a Intel Mac, or more slowly than 6.x ran on a PowerPC Mac? I can't have Retrospect tying up my computer for extended periods of time. Not only that but EMC had been promising Mac users a new version of Retrospect (8.0) was coming for three years before it finally happened. How long is it going to be before they release an upgraded version with the promised \\"performance boosts\\". I'm not going to be holding my breath.	2009-08-19

I found Solus Pro 2.0 at a nearby store and picked it up, thinking it was just the thing.  Well, I'm a bit disappointed, and here's why:<br />First, reading a map on your Palm is a lot harder than reading a printed map, for some reason.  Expect to be disoriented a lot.<br />The maps on the CD work pretty well (I was using the San Francisco map).  I could find places to go reasonably well.  My biggest gripes are the speed (slooow), and the fact that street names don't always follow the street.  For example, if I look up a street that runs the length of the city, and then zoom in on it, it's name is not necessarily displayed any longer.  This was very frustrating when zoomed far in, as few if any of the streets I was looking for were labelled.<br /> ...  I downloaded a map of the city I live in, and found it fairly useless.  Zoomed out, it displays no streets.  Zoomed in, many streets simply have no name.  The size of the map is also very limited, and no location (businesses, restaurants, etc.) data is included.<br />Overall, this is a decent product for the maps that are included on the CD.  I'd hesitate to recommend it's use outside of those areas.  And I'm still looking for that ultimate mapping software package...	2001-07-20

I'm not sure why Trend Micro gets so many bad reviews, it is by far the best security program I've had on my computer. I had Norton 360 and then Mcafee before this and here's what they showed after a scan-  360 said I had no security issues on the computer.  Mcafee(total protection) said I had 6.  I tried Trend Micro and low and behold-67! All spyware.   How could the other two not pick these up?? I immediately switched to pro and will not go to another program.  Pros-easy to install and pretty quick about doing it. 2. As mentioned before picks up things the others aren't. 3. Doesn't bombard you with constant messages(pop-ups and such)  Cons-a little slow at scanning, although that's a minor nuisance considering what it picks up. And the other would be seems that every other update it has to revert back because it says \\"problem with latest update\\" but at least it doesn't interfere with operating your computer.

Having purchased Disney learning cd's in the past which were labeled for the age groups of \\"Preschool\\" and \\"Ages 3-6\\", we naturally thought that software labeled for \\"Ages 4-6\\" would be at least at the same level as the \\"Ages 3-6\\", and hopefully a little more challenging.  This wasn't the case at all.  Their idea of \\"Simple Arithmetic\\" is to have the child click on the number that is said and then the game counts that number of balloons for them.  This is nothing more than number identification for the child. The \\"Early Reading and Spelling\\" consists of matching a word to a picture, or finding a picture that starts with a featured letter.  \\"Language and Verbs\\" doesn't teach anything at all.  The child just clicks on one of three words, all verbs, and watches Tigger perform that action.  Someone tell me, how does choosing between \\"sit\\", \\"dance\\", and \\"bounce\\" teach a person anything about language or verbs!  I won't even get started on the lazy way in which the foreign language is incorporated.  <br />The only redeeming section of this software is the part where Tigger is helped in following a treasure map.  This was a nice way of teaching compass directions.<br />This game was cheaply done in every way - content to graphics.  Such a shame.  Two other Disney learning software titles that we thought were decent, Ready for Math and Ready to Read, were much better.  ...	2003-01-01

This review is intended for the novice, like myself.<br /><br />Prior to using Lightroom, I had been using the iPhoto software that comes preinstalled on every new Mac.  I had become proficient with iPhoto, but was acutely aware of it's limitations since i was unable to fix my recent wedding pictures.  For anyone who has ever shot a photo using the wrong white balance, you know what I'm talking about.  The color saturation is off, the exposure, the contrast - everything.  I was convinced my wedding pictures were worthless until I edited them with Lightroom.<br /><br />This was my first project after installing Lightroom and the ability to adjust the white balance of my wedding pictures alone was worth the price.  All of the photos were taken with the white balance of the camera set to \\"florescent\\" light although the room was lit with \\"tungsten\\" light.  Because of this, all the the colors were off and no amount of adjusting with iPhoto could fix it.  With Lightroom, all I had to do was change the white balance settings for the entire group of photos from \\"florescent\\" to \\"tungsten\\" and the entire batch was almost perfect!<br /><br />There are many other features of the program that I'm still learning, but this one alone is a great feature for correcting a common mistake.<br /><br />I've only been using the program for about a month, so I've much more to learn before I can write a detailed review.	2013-07-19

Look, we don't have a lot of computer games and we had just recently discovered the I Spy books about 1 year ago. We loved them so much that I do believe we'd read nearly all of them before I saw this game for sale. This excellent little collection of picture puzzles is not repeated from the books, so to us they're all new. It was like a breath of fresh air from a parent's point of view; games without that constant, annoying background music, the kids can play them quietly and actually learn something. The boys love it even more than I; they have been begging to play I Spy Mystery every day after their homework is done for the past week since they got it.    The game is simple. You select one of 13 folders, each is its own mini mystery with a theme (Mystery Meal, Locked Gate, Skeleton Key, etc). You have 3-5 \\"pictures\\" in each folder to find the hidden objects, and when you have solved all of the pictures, you are given clues to solve the final mystery. this involves a sharp eye, but also logic, good recall for details, and problem solving skills. Kids will also learn to employ multiple meanings for a word in their search, such as \\"bat\\".    I Spy Mystery, like all the books, is a fun and low pressure way to build the brain. I get caught up in it with them from time to time -- I've even added my name to the player file so I don't mess up their scores when I sneak a round. And now that we are intrigued by some of the folders, we will make an effort to find the other I Spy games. Thank God for Scholastic!  -Andrea, aka Merribelle	2008-04-01

Thankfully, I got it on discount, but even then, it is not worth it.<br /><br />I am a new Mac owner. Previously, like many other people, I used Microsoft OneNote, and I really missed it when I switched. Circus Ponies calls this a OneNote replacement, but again, like other reviewers here, I have to completely disagree.<br /><br />OneNote allowed me to organize my information… Circus Ponies is good for storing / linking information, but it is absolutely horrible at the organization thing.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Automatic table of contents<br />+ Dividers, with direct links to each individual page within their sections<br />+ Linking between cells & pages<br />+ Elements are separate & can be rearranged later, if you don’t like where you initially put them<br />+ Importing related documents/files<br />+ Cell Control<br />+ Checkboxes, priority items, & due dates<br />+ Voice annotation & importing mp3 into iTunes<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Every page type other than Notes is essentially useless, if you want/need more than the bare bones<br />- Very little control over how you can organize your information (e.g., no bullets in tables)<br />- Buggy software<br />- Very cluttered interface (e.g., text runs all the way to the edge, unless you want to give up automatic/flexible margins)<br />- Notebook metaphor taken too literally in some cases (e.g., Sticky Notes block all of the text in the notebook underneath)<br />- Menu navigation<br />- Contrary to what it claims, NoteBook does not export to Word in any meaningful way. My notes are tables-heavy. The point of notes is to summarize the information, after all. But after making several tables and trying to export the page to Word, all I got was the text, without any sort of table separating items<br /><br />If this were version 1.x, I could forgive them, but I see a reference to NoteBook 3.0 on Circus Ponies’ website from back in 2008. As it’s now 2013, and we’re still on version 3.1.3, I’m guessing that they don’t do much updating. This is unacceptable.<br /><br />I’m really disappointed with Circus Ponies, even as a non-OneNote-replacement. This is why:<br /><br />- A severely anemic Cornell Notes Page. Given Circus Ponies’ own acknowledgment that Cornell Notes is the most popular note-taking format among North American students, it’s baffling that this page type is so limited in an app which is marketed specifically for taking and organizing notes, presumably by students. For example, I can’t get bullet points (I’m not talking about Cell Control, but actual bullets), except in a very roundabout way. The indents don’t work the way they would for an outline. Outlines are also standard in the American education system! I’m actually looking into installing Windows on my Mac now, because I need 2+ columns to take notes in, and I need outlining (with bulletpoints and numbered lists) capabilities. Everything else is nice to have, but not essential, the way those two features are. These are basic features, by the way, but they are completely missing here.<br /><br />- Buggy software. I’ll be typing in a Sticky Note, when text suddenly appears in the notebook in the background, even though I never moved the cursor. Trying to select text is also a pain, as the cursor often disappears, or the highlighted portion is both not what you selected AND not what NoteBook thinks you selected (i.e., if you start typing, a completely different selection — not what’s highlighted onscreen — gets erased & replaced with the new text). Also, when I start typing in a Sticky Note, the Sticky Note will become unlinked from its cell.<br /><br />- Cell Control should really be made available to ALL note types. Seriously, what is the point of the other note types, if they’re going to be less capable than similar features in every other program?<br /><br />- You can’t make your own templates. When a product ismeant for handling lots of information, then it’s not unexpected that the organizational schemes a customer implements — not to mention, tweaks like color schemes — might get rather complicated… Saving a blank notebook “template,” and copying it yourself before using it every time, is a very inelegant solution. And Heaven forbid if you forget to save a duplicate before working on it.<br /><br />- The bullet choices available are insufficient. I want the black square. It’s standard, more than some of the other ones given (and less visually distracting), so I don’t know why it was omitted.<br /><br />- Where is the right margin? The text goes right up to the edge of the window, and in the Cornell Notes Page, right up to the dividing line (and the text in the next column starts right at the line, so that you can’t really tell they’re 2 separate columns, which makes reading it all the more confusing). Forums suggest changing my System Preferenes, or using the View &#62; Rule menu, but neither option is good for me in their actual implementations.<br /><br />- Checkboxes should have the option of being pulled out of the body of the text and into the margin, like the due dates, etc. I find them highly distracting when trying to view, and especially study, the text. They are also more difficult to find than simply looking over into the column.<br /><br />- Menu navigation is a convoluted process. Some functions are made easier to find by customizing your toolbar, but it’s still too much. I know there are keyboard shortcuts, but I really cannot remember them all.<br /><br />- It’s not obvious when Voice Annotate is on or off.<br /><br />- Sticky Notes, etc., do not automatically resize themselves or have a simple one-click option to expand/collapse them if you write more than the space allows.<br /><br />- Sticky Flags are labeled, and I can’t figure out how to unlabel them. I don’t want “fax” or “urgent”; for school, I want “summary,” “questions,” or even no title, which takes up precious space on the side.<br /><br />- Export to Word failed on me. Nothing I've done is helping, and customer service is still working on that one. One out of three files is not a good percentage for corrupted files.<br /><br />- Tables do not export properly to Word, either. Apparently, there are 2 different ways to make Tables in Circus Ponies, and I chose the wrong one… This should not even be an option! If you advertise yourself as being able to export to Word, then EVERYTHING should export to Word properly. My exported tables show text, but no table lines or even separations.

I'd rate it 5 (or more) if it took better advantage of the video card, but the graphics are still great and I think it's quicker (and more stable than Win XP on an actual PC - go figure...)	2008-05-05

You'll hear \\"learn like a baby,\\" or \\"instant immersion.\\"<br /><br />Well, the concept sounds very convincing and tempting, to tap all that untapped potential that you never knew you had. However, this learning platform has many problems.<br /><br />Ask your friend who claims that it worked for him/her.<br /><br />Just ask him/her how to say \\"Hello, how are you? What is your name?\\" In the language they're studying. I guarantee you, if they have been relying on Rosetta Stone, they will not be able to say these simple, but vital phrases. I guarantee you they will be able to tell you \\"The boy is on top of the airplane.\\" That does you a lot of good when you're trying to order food, or ask directions right?<br /><br />The only redeeming quality of this system is that, if used with a traditional learning program (and you're still pretty new) it will serve as an excellent source of basic vocabulary. Furthermore, it will offer some game-like learning and assist in learning about numbers, colors, foods, animals, common household items, body parts. It will also help the learner to describe situations, which at more advanced stages of learning will be useful.<br /><br />Where R.S. falls horribly short is on the conversational instruction. If used properly, you can actually learn a few useful things, but how could you ever tell someone \\"I am from America\\" if you are never taught? R.S. may teach you how to say \\"this item is from such and such person,\\" but again the things you learn are virtually out of context. I went through ALL of the lessons and was never able to express basic things.<br /><br />R.S. feels more like a game, where you randomly click and get something right or wrong, then you're supposed to learn without looking up the words. It's EXTREMELY passive learning. You'll have an easy time getting the right answer, but employing it in any kind of real conversation is going to be difficult. There are slightly more active ways to practice (such as speech practice), or such as answering by typing, but even these will fall short.<br /><br />So my final verdict is:<br /><br />The marketing is a gimmick, adults don't learn like children. Adults need repetition and explanations. Children's minds are able to accept the new information without a filter, adults can not.<br /><br />The learning is passive, the words you learn will hole up in your passive vocabulary. You won't learn how to say most of the basic things that travelers, or even students of Indonesian would need to say.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is extremely overpriced, especially given that it doesn't deliver what is expected of it. And the redeeming factor is that if you are already learning Indonesian, it will SUPPLEMENT your course, NOT replace it. So buyer beware.<br /><br />I would advise checking this out from a library before you pay for it.s to practice (such as speech practice), or such as answering by typing, but even these will fall short.<br /><br />So my final verdict is:<br /><br />The marketing is a gimmick, adults don't learn like children.

Another way to avoid it is to copy and paste your text rather than placing it. <br />Resizing images? Easy! You can resize the frame and fit to the frame, resize the image and fit the frame to the image, you can resize both simulatenously, you can even create a star-shaped frame and place an image into it! Your frame can have a feathered or rounded edge if you want, etc. I've never had a problem resizing images quickly and easily. <br />Type styles: The workarounds for this are much more printer friendly. Want a bold? Make a character style that &quot;strokes&quot; the outline of the font with a .1 or .25 point stroke. You can just eyedropper it in place where you need it or create a paragraph or character style to place it. Need a faux italic? Same thing...just &quot;slant&quot; the text in the character box.<br />Of course the character and paragraph styles are separate! They'd be too big otherwise! Most of the time I'm just using paragraph styles--I don't need to see the character styles. If I need to do both, I just undock the character style palette and then both are visible at once. I can even dock them together &quot;stacked&quot; without difficulty so they're not floating separate but both are visible.<br />Too many palettes? Close the ones you don't use. Minimize the ones you infrequently use. Note that the upcoming version, InDesign Creative Suite will allow for even more docking options, so you can choose how it looks.<br />Optical Kerning? Works great on my printer, I don't know what's wrong with yours. When I look at similar documents pre and post InDesign, I'm blown away by how much BETTER the ID documents always look.<br />Underline text? What's wrong with ctrl alt U? You can also set a character style for underlining, and eyedropper from one place to the next. <br />Gimmicky CD covers? We do a trade journal, myriad ads, newsletters, marketing in InDesign and they've never looked better or gone together faster.<br />I've used PageMaker. This program is to PageMaker what PageMaker was to the older versions of Publisher. It is so much faster, easier and more intuitive. No more repetitive stress injuries for me from doing the same key combos over and over and over again. I use about 1/8th the number of clicks I needed before to accomplish the same task. There are tasks I never would have bothered trying in PageMaker. And those who've used both Quark and InDesign by and large say ID has far more features and is much better to use.	2003-10-02

Have used TrendMicro since about 1998 when my very, very good Geek recommended it as well as recommendations from some other computer guru types I knew.  TM is still one of the top recommended. The best part is that it doesn't take up as much space in the computer as Norton or McAfee and doesn't create the problems and issues with other programs or internet that they do either. I also have not had any virus, hacking or malware problems since using this program!<br /><br />Can't say it doesn't create any, but the ones it does were never as problematic as the McAfee gave.  Most of the time the issues were simple slowdowns when deep scanning was being done - this version doesn't seem to have that issue.<br /><br />Had a few other issues with past versions, but the recommendation was simply to totally uninstall the program and re-install it.  Seemed to work pretty well, too. Apparently, when installing itself back then, it didn't completely uninstall all bits of the old versions of itself and some corruptions occurred. I learned to how track down through the start button search window all the TM bits and get rid of them before re-installing the program.  Haven't had to do that in quite a few years, though.<br /><br />Heard too many bad things about Norton's space hogging and other issues to even try them, so don't have any 1st hand experiences.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to others!	2012-09-09

Once you down load the latest patch from the McAfee web site, it's fine. This does not bother me for two reasons. First, who on the planet has ever had dealings with a Microsoft product that was perfect the first time? There are hardly any pieces of software that are 100% bug free in version x.0. That's why reputable vendors have Web sites and patches. If you have spent any amount of time in the computer world you know what I mean. There is nothing like getting a service pack for you NOS that makes things worse and takes down 500 some hosts. It happens. Now, if the vendor doesn't have a patch, okay we have a problem.<BR>    Second, this is an advanced piece of software. This ain't no Ford Pinto. We're talking about a Lamborghini. If you want that kind of power and performance, you may have to deal with a bit of tweaking. But the results are awesome. <BR>    Now I hear you whining &quot;But I don't want to buy a product that I have to service immediately.&quot; As soon as you bought a computer, this is what you get. Don't like it? Buy a toaster! <BR>    Most problems I have seen users run into are because they either A} are the 1 in 1000 people who are going to have a problem with whatever they try to run B} Don't get the patch C} are running Norton.<BR>     Now, C is interesting. McAfee stuff won't work with Norton, and Norton won't work with McAfee. I'm mad now! You mean to tell me I can't run my Windows version of Word on a Mac! This is what software companies do to keep away competition. You have to commit to either McAfee or Norton. They can't and won't play together and that is the way BOTH of them want it. If you have Norton currently and want to go to McAfee, or want to mix the two, understand you must choose one or the other. It's like a bad soap opera.

DNS 11.5 Home was a lightning deal yesterday (10/2/11) so I snagged it, thinking it was a great deal. I now regret, so very much, having purchased this product. The installation, on my Dell Inspiron N4110 was a terrible hassle. I got the same error over and over again regarding the state of my visual c++ runtime environment - it needed to be upgraded to the DNS version, but the DNS version didn't want to, but would if I wanted to risk a busted install. I spent at least two hours looking around the web for solutions to this and trying the various things that various websites, including the Nuance website, suggested. Finally, I simply proceeded with the installation and risked the busted install. I guess that's what I got. The install finished, I read a few training texts to get the software used to my voice and speech patterns, etc. Now, whenever I try to run another training text, I get an error when DNS tries to update my profile.

The trial worked well. I really liked the program. But when the boxed version arrived, I uninstalled the trial version. Now the boxed version won't install. I spent a day online trying to find a solution but to no avail. I'm not sure why one worked and the other didn't. Maybe Windows Vista did a faulty uninstall. Maybe it is the software. I don't know.  But I guess I will have to return it and try a different editor though.  That being said, if it works for you, it is a nice program. I especially liked the proxy function.  Addendum: Just looked at the return policy. It seems you can't return software unless the box has not been opened. So I guess it is a complete loss. I would advise anyone to check with Corel before takng the free download to paid route to using the software.  Addendum 2: I was finally able to talk with a customer support representative after being on hold for over an hour. That being said, the representative was very courteous and helpful. He stayed on the phone throughout the whole installation process even though it was fairly slow. The problem appears to have been with my optical drive not being able to read the disc properly. So he had me copy the disc to my hard drive and install from there. That solved the problem and the install went smoothly. So far I have been very happy with the product.	2012-01-22

Came home, uninstalled everything and the product would not work. Called Trendmicro support-the company does not even have an effective telephone system-if its busy you just have to call back (took 53 times-yes I was bored). Finally spent 70 minutes on the phone troubleshooting-never got it to work and finally got disconnected (I was not abusive at all, Jens was very nice and tried, just did not succeed). Went back to Best Buy where I got conflicting information from my previous visit. They were equally stumped but gave me another copy-which of course does not work either. All it says is please wait while Windows configures Trendmicro-then nothing happens and it won't install. To say this has been an irritating and time wasting experience might be the understatement of the year. I hope others have success with it because I certainly haven't.	2007-11-07

Over the last several days I spent over 5 hours with techs from India (nice people) trying to \\"fix\\" Norton Anti-virus 2005.  They wanted to spend another hour or so with me and I said I've had enough--I just want a new product sent to me.  The site they sent me to wants me to mail everything back, including my receipts, fill out a form, etc., wait 5-6 weeks.  And can I talk to anyone at Symantec about my frustration and anger?  Of course not!  Try their web site and see if there's any way at all you can talk to a human being and get the customer service you should be able to get after you spend 5 hours of your time trying to help them fix their crappy product.  I have 4 computers and, when current subscriptions run out, I absolutely will switch to another company for my security needs.  Symantec has proven to me once and for all they don't give a rat's behind about the customer.  OK, guess what, I don't care about them either.

As a consequence, perhaps its publisher does not feel the need to improve it. One obvious way to improve its speech recognition capabilities would be for the user to load a previously written text and then read that text back to Dragon. In this way the user, perhaps someone with a disability, would be able to train Dragon using minimal keystrokes. The current system requires the user to read in text and then edit text. The consequence is a time-consuming, and for the user with disabilities painful, process.given the existing capacities of the software, it seems that this innovation could've been produced long ago.    In addition, the first level of technical support is minimally competent. The supervisors have much more experience. The result is that the first level technician can give out faulty information.	2011-05-05

Constant bugs old and new.  I threw away $50	I cannot find a single new feature in this version except the credit score (compared to Quicken 2013).  And not even that works.  I repeatedly entered my correct information and was told it didn't match Quicken's information.  Worse, the auto update repeatedly freezes and I have to use task manager to kill the Quicken thread.  I can only imagine that this will corrupt my data file sooner or later.  Then, when you reopen, everything works ok.  I've also noticed in this version that you can no longer cut-and-paste anything in any register entry field!?  In addition, when you change the amount of a split transaction and it prompts you to adjust splits, if you hit enter, the focus is on the FOLLOWING transaction and it throws an error instead of opening the current transaction to modify the splits.  It's things like this that make me wonder if they test their product whatsoever.<br /><br />I'm learning to despise Quicken.  I've been using it for over 20 years and it keeps getting buggier.  The testing and quality control is miserably bad.  They never go back and fix existing issues.  Normally, you expect to get at least the same experience you had in the previous version (with the bugs resolved).  But instead, they don't fix old bugs and keep introducing new ones.  Their support organization is also miserable.  It's based in India and the people on the phone typically have no idea what you are talking about.<br /><br />This upgrade was a free $50 gift to Intuit for absolutely nothing.	2015-02-12

It is so nice, in fact, that when I decided to go from PC to Mac, I purchased another copy to use, even though Garageband came free on the Mac!  Although a beginner can use this program, it is not a toy.  It will produce as sophisticated a product as you want to write, or you can use the pre-sets to instantly make any type of music you prefer.  Then it will print out the sheet music for you, if you desire.<br /><br />Although you can buy the basic program, then add more selections of pre-programed music later, if you've used other products, I'd suggest just going ahead and getting the \\"Pro\\" version, because you'll quickly be wanting to use the full range of instrumentation available in the more costly product. Even though I'm retired now, I refuse to do without this product - it's just too much fun.	2010-09-07

There is nothing that makes me go &#34;wow&#34; about the Power PDF version.  I had upgraded to Windows 8.1 and decided to upgrade a few programs at the same time.  Eventually older programs won't work/aren't supported, so I try to stay somewhat current.  From an unsophisticated users perspective, the controls have changed, but the basic scanning functions (which are about the only thing I use) are essentially the same.  Apparently Nuance requires you to uninstall the software before reinstalling it (a restriction to prevent usage on multiple computers) which is a hassle, and more so when a computer crashes and everything has to be reinstalled from scratch.  Occasionally I do a &#34;clean install&#34; of Windows just to get rid of the various junk items which build up over time, so I'll see<br />how the Nuance reinstall goes at that time.

Perhaps the best metaphore is that Jumpstart 3rd Grade is like a theatricaly released film and Jumpstart Typing is like a direct-to-video release. For one thing, there is no CGI animation in Jumpstart Typing, like there is in Jumpstart 3rd Grade. For another there is a lote less at stake in the plot. Jumpstart Typing isn't really like a prequel or a sequel, just a different adventure in the same world.<br />The only recuring charactors are Prof. Spark, Polly and Botley. This is a bit disapointing that we don't see any other charactors from Jumpstart 3rd Grade, especially since we only meet one new charactor. Jumpstart Typing is set at Sparks Stadium like Jumpstart 3rd Grade is set at Mystery Mountain. Mystery Mountain is the Sparks' home. Sparks Stadium is the first stadium for interplanetary keyborad competition, though this seems to contradict with Botley's statement in Jumpstart 3rd Grade that Prof. Spark hasn't ever found any alien transmissions to decode. All the recuring charactors look like they do in Jumpstart 3rd, probably beecause they recycled animations from Jumpstart 3rd Grade, for instance, note that Botley's pose in the main stadium scene is exactly the same seen on the 2nd Floor of Mystery Mountain in Jumpstart 3rd Grade. However, new charactors look true to the animation in Jumpstart 3rd Grade.<br />Overall, the charactor's personalities are true to Jumpstart 3rd Grade. Botley and Prof. Spark are entirly in charactor, but then again, Prof. Spark hardly appears in either. Polly is a bit out of charactor, she is nicer. One could atribute this to the fact that her father is at Sparks Stadium, though we don't see him 'till the end, rather than far away at some convention. However, she locks Coach Qwerty in the trophy room for the same reason she sends all those robots back in time.<br />Acadamically, this is sort of Mavis Beaconfor Kids and the is the setup is similar to Jumpstart 3rd Grade. However, though Jumpstart 3rd Grade is set rather fluidly, Jumpstart Typing's setup is rather convoluted. We take Lessons and Timed Typing Tests to fine \\"strength\\" to play the games, but to win we have take the Timed Typing Tests. Playing the games is useless, unless you want a bunch stupid medals!<br />In conclution, this is game is fairly effective at teaching keyboarding, though better at teaching speed typing than the basics. However, it fails to capture the fun of Jumpstart 3rd Grade.	2003-10-10

I bought it for its size and hardware features; unfortunately the only OS choice was Vista.      After five years waiting for the brain trust in Redmond to ship a \\"killer OS\\" to replace XP, Vista is a complete let-down.  Think Windows XP Service Pack 3.  All they did was pretty up the windows - ooooh, transparency! - and add so-called \\"security\\" features that put the onus of keeping the operating system from being invaded on the user.      Not much else has changed except the speed (way slower), amount of RAM and processor resources it uses (way more), peripheral compatibility (have an HP printer older than two years?  Good luck!) and the locations/names of often used components (\\"Add and Remove Programs\\" is now \\"Programs and Features\\").  Not exactly worth the $350 price tag.    Boot-to-Desktop takes four times longer than XP on the same machine.  Shutdown takes five times longer.  Opening Word 2007 takes ten seconds in Vista; the splash screen for Word barely appears when launching in XP.      User Account Control - Microsoft's primary solution for security - is a huge annoyance for experienced users and a confusing mess for non-technical users.  It's also a slap in the face - \\"Oh, you want more secure operating system?  Our huge team of developers and engineers couldn't really come up with any ideas, so we present a new acronym: UAC!  Have fun, and if you let a trojan take over your system, it's not our fault!  Love, Microsoft.\\"    I won't get into great detail here.  Suffice it to say that Vista is incredibly slow compared to XP; requires an inordinate amount of RAM and processor to accomplish this reduction in speed; still requires 3rd-party antimalware software to be secure; and is a ridiculously expensive bloated behemoth of an operating system that has very few merits that aren't already found in XP.    Stick with XP.  Maybe Windows 7 will be better.	2008-03-10

The change of the fiscal year caused the the program on it's own to limit access in certain data areas. Worse than the glitches is the offensive customer service.  Rude techs, (different people) with the same relational problems who deem customer service behavior to include telling the customer that if they \\"read the manual\\" or the \\"agreement\\" then there would be no need for the phone calls.

It crashes regularly, tracks drop out for no reason in the middle of songs, and sometimes it won't even record. All this stuff might merely be an inconvenience, because the program itself is very user friendly and intuitive and would probably be fantastic if you could iron the bugs out. What puts the nail in the coffin is that Magix has possibly the worst customer support I've ever encountered. Their automated phone system doesn't work AT ALL. It transfers you to random departments (usually to a voicemail) and if you call sales instead of technical support, they'll tell you to call technical support. When you explain to them that you can't get through to tech support, they'll tell you try again. What I've learned from this experience is that any technology Magix touches, from DAWs to phone systems, turns to garbage.	2012-07-03

Further, the first year I prepared my return using both Turbo Tax and Tax Act. I did this because I wanted to see what the differences were. I ended up going with Tax Act even though I had been using Turbo Tax. I have not regretted the decision even though last year I prepared my return using both programs as well (just to see changes with Turbo Tax).     The main reasons I prefer Tax Act over Turbo Tax are 1) Tax Act is significantly cheaper, 2) Tax Act fills out the FAFSA form for you as well, which is extremely helpful if you are a student looking for financial aid, 3) Tax Act doesn't try and up sell you every step of the way, and 4) Tax Act doesn't make extreme modifications to its program every year.      I think Turbo Tax is misleading. It advertises that it files the federal return for free. This, however, only applies to the EZ form. So, if you have any investment income to claim or mortgage interest to deduct forget about it. When I would use Turbo Tax, I'd generally pay about $60 dollars, and it tried to up sell me the whole way so that I'd pay even more. I filed the same return using Tax Act. Tax Act advertises the full service online price as $17.95. The disk is slightly more. Further, if you filed with Tax Act the prior year, Tax Act sends you an email allowing you to sign up to file early and save even more money.     No doubt, Turbo Tax has the slicker user interface. It is very flashy, but in my opinion unnecessarily so. Further, Turbo Tax often dramatically changes the interface every year so one has to familiarize yourself with it every year. Tax Act on the other hand, for the most part keeps the same interface and only makes minor improvements. Accordingly, you remember how to use the program better. I also think Tax Act allows you to manipulate the information better. With Turbo Tax I'd often have a hard time correcting an error manually if the program wasn't presenting the information correctly. TaxAct does a more then adequate job of asking all the right questions for the return to be completed properly.     The customer service people with Tax Act were very helpful the one time I had to call. I had an issue where Turbo Tax asked me information about how much I paid for vehicle registration to claim as a deduction. Tax Act didn't ask me the same question. After talking to Tax Act, I learned the deduction didn't apply in my State. I researched the issue and was satisfied Tax Act was correct and that Turbo Tax shouldn't be claiming the deduction for me. Further, the gentleman I spoke with spoke English clearly. Big plus. The one time I had to call Turbo tax, the guy 1) wanted to charge me for the call, and 2) sounded like he was in India and that he just learned English a week ago.	2011-02-07

I got this for use in d20 3.5 campaign. It only has basic classes. if you want to play anything else, you have to create it. But, it is impossible to create anything in it. It is extremely complicated, and not at all, no not one bit, for casual user.<br /><br />It saves time if you are creating a core class character with core items from core rulebooks. But if you are looking for things from other books, including prestige classes, and optional or homebrewed items, it is much easier to do it with paper and pen. In fact that is the only possible way to do it.<br /><br />Another note: Once character is created, the program produces a glorified, nice looking character sheet with a nice logo and portrait,but it is still clumsy with lists and tables are broken awkwardly between pages.<br /><br />Again, you could do way better with paper and pen, and still save time. This I hope saves you the $30 in addition to that time and frustration.	2014-03-02

There are too many exercises with annoyingly repetitive phrases which block rapid progress, self-tests are not scored nor stored nor compared to previous performance, and therefore not very useful. The words chosen for learning are not very stimulating either. There is also writing control, but also here the score is not being stored to monitor improvement. All in all I have problems moving on because the experience is so boring. There would be better Spanish learning CDs, but they usually are for PC and much cheaper than the Rosetta stone products (see online comparison reviews). Pronunciation control is available, but does the visual control really help me to get better or could it be a bit confusing if the graphs do not really overlap? Maybe I will learn Spanish by simply travelling to South America and being forced to deal with it, or by watching Spanish TV....	2007-05-12

You'd think this would be a no-brainer based on the claims on the packaging. But even if you are a Windows user BEWARE!<br />I tried to run Copy Commander on no less than three different systems from a Pentium-4 down to an old Pentium II. COPY COMMANDER WOULDN'T EVEN START ON ANY OF THEM. On one, it did nothing...just hung at the intro screen. On the other two it continuously rebooted after it's &quot;welcome&quot; screen. I never even got a chance to try a copy.<br />And lest you think this is a Linux problem, be aware that Copy Commander (like any disk copy utility) boots its own OS from the CDROM, so this had absolutely nothing to do with Linux.<br />It's shocking to me that a piece of software could get in the field if it fails so miserably on 3 completely different systems. Do yourself a favor...save your money and look elsewhere. (I ended up doing a low-level 'dd' copy in Linux <BR>which worked fine and was free...)	2003-01-02

I wish I could return the program, but it seems that there are no returns for software purchased in Amazon (or any other store where you buy software AFAIK-As Far As I Know)<br />As for the software features I think it's easy to use and there are tons of clipart that you can use to customize your cards.	2013-12-18

Throughout that time I have only gotten one virus and it was my own stupidity that caused that issue. I clicked on something that I should have known better and got infected, but Norton's tools were able to rectify it and within a couple of hours I was back to normal. In fact after nearly twenty installs I have only needed to contact Norton support twice. In both cases my only issue was to have them combine my old and new subscriptions. Norton has always bee pretty intuitive, easy to use, and requires little effort. They have been repeatedly ranked in the top 5 of security software several years in a row, roll out updates often, and have held over 60% of the market share in the past. You don't do that by selling snake oil. The largest complaint about Norton seems to come from those whose main complaint is that it is a resource hog. While I can't deny that it does use more resources than some of it's competitors many of those who tested it will attest that it also works better than most of those competitors, and no I don't work for them.

I can say right now out of the 56 songs, I already recognize (love) 36 songs from the anime series and I believe the rest is from the visual novel game. Magome Togoshi, Shinji Orito, and Jun Maeda have created some of the most amazing music I have ever heard. Words cannot explain how AMAZING the music is.<br /><br />The one complaint I have to say is that the album song list and booklet is in Japanese (I can't read Japanese) but still, I rate this product a 5/5 stars. It also has music score (in the booklet) so if you know how to play the piano or violin, you can play some of the music of Clannad.<br /><br />It does not have the Dango Daikazoku song but it has the instrumental version and a different lyrics version too. It does not have the Clannad After Story intro song but it does have the piano version. Other than that, almost every other song heard either in the anime or visual novel is in this CD set. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who loved or at least watched the series. For the price of $49.99 it is definitely worth it.	2014-06-18

The software has so many problems that it is difficult to get anything meaningful out of it.  I'm not a genius, but I am an electrical engineer and usually do pretty good with computers.  During tests, the window will sometimes move partially off the screen so that you can't see the whole question, and will not move back.  The reading comprehension sections omit words and sentances.  In the math section, pictures and symbols will be distorted so that you cannot read them.  Worst off, I spent 3 1/2 hours taking a full length practice GMAT, but when I went to review the answers, due to some glitch the program would only let me look at the first question.  Its hard to learn when you can't see what you've done right and wrong.  I did, by the way, load this program on two different computers, so I don't think my system is causing the problems.  Oh, and if the companion palm software is a big point for you (as it was for me), don't be fooled.  It consists of one hundered math problems, many of which give the wrong answer (yes - I checked my math with others to make sure I wasn't wrong - in fact, the frequency of wrong answers became a bit of a joke among my coworkers who were all trying to study on work time).  All in all, it is difficult to learn anything when the software doesn't work half the time, and when it does you can't be sure about the correctness of the answers.  I've had better luck with the Princton Review book and software, though they tend to dumb down the material a bit, and their online services aren't nearly as useful as they claim when you buy the book.	2002-08-06

Like any video editing software, the more processing power and ram you can throw at it, the better.

I love Adobe Illustrator, but the font used for the activation code on the prepaid subscription card has an issue--some of the letters look like numbers.  So if you input your code and get a message that it's invalid, take the card to good light and check and see if any of the \\"numbers\\" could actually be letters.  \\"S\\" looks only slightly different from 5, and \\"D\\" looks a whole lot like 0.  A kind person from Adobe figured out what I was doing wrong.<br /><br />Once you activate the subscription you'll have to download the software.  If you get a message indicating that it's a 30-day trial, click the License This Software button and sign in with your Adobe ID (if you don't have one already, you'll be asked to create one when you activate your subscription).  That should get rid of the 30-day trial language for future launches.	2013-04-04

Being a Mac lover at heart but a PC user for years out of necessity, I've been waiting for this day when I could get back to the Mac yet have the capability of using Windows based software if necessary. I just took the plunge, converted to a MacBook and installed Parallels 3.0 with Windows XP Pro. Parallels 3.0 is better than I imagined. With the Coherence mode, you can't even tell you're running 2 operating systems! I seamlessly move, cut and paste, etc between applications on both platforms. This really is the Holy Grail for now. It sure seems weird, though, to have the Windows start up sound coming from my Mac!	2007-12-18

I've been running Microsoft OSs since MS-DOS 2.11, but this is the first time I've actually decided to \\"downgrade\\" to Windows 7.<br /><br />The new Metro apps are essentially unusable on a large 24\\" screen: everything is full screen with huge fonts and buttons, and multitask capabilities are reduced. You have essentially a 24\\" smartphone. Moreover, at this point in time, there are no really useful Metro apps available.<br /><br />The desktop is still there but definitely crippled when compared to the Windows 7 desktop: you need to revert to full screen when you need to start an application or search for something, losing sight of whatever you had on your desktop. Aero graphics effects are also missing, probably to have the OS fast even on low-end mobile platforms: graphically it's closer to Windows 95 than Windows 7.<br /><br />Summarizing: good OS for tablets or phones (even if I'm not convinced I would like this, Apple iOS seems to be far more intuitive), but for desktop PCs this is a total disaster!<br /><br />EDIT: just a quick note: the score is so low since this is a review of the \\"Windows 8 Pro\\" update package from older (and, in my view, better) Windows versions; it would be at least 3 stars if this was a review of an implementation on tablet or phone.<br /><br />There has to be a different way to obtain integration between PC and mobile architectures: having the Desktop as the main PC interface with Metro apps running in a window would have been much better than this hybrid, in my opinion.	2012-10-29

US	50038433	R4DI58O5LEM4J	B0017I8NQM	337559226	Wordperfect Office X4 Standard	Software	5	1	1	Y	N	I'll freely admit . . .	. . . I'm one of those few persons who actually prefer WordPerfect to Microsoft Word.  When I first entered the working world, I learned how to use the DOS based version of WordPerfect, and the software served me well through graduate school and a Master's Thesis.  As recently as 8 years ago, I was still using it in an office setting where, honestly, it worked better with the particular system we were using.  And I've consistently continued to use it in my fairly extensive personal writing at home.  Why?  Because, while I've found WordPerfect slightly less \\"user friendly\\" than Word, for the type of writing that I have done and continue to do, I've found that the program can do more.    This version is every bit as good and as previous versions I've used (and better than some).  I've been very pleased.  I was also pleased at the ease of compatibility I've found when working on documents created in other formats -- something WordPerfect has not always been great about.    While I'll admit that my primary reason for selecting this product was for the word processing, I want to say a brief word about the QuattroPro spreadsheet.  While Excel is far and away the most widely used spreadsheet today, I (and many others) cut my teeth on Lotus 1-2-3.  This version of QuattroPro allows the user to utilize not only its own format, but also 1-2-3 as well as Excel.  For dealing with older documents (or for persons more familiar with earlier programs) this is a great feature.    I highly recommend this product.	2008-10-16

You have to pay an average of between [$$$] for each extra instrument [along with the vocoder and space designer] so the [$$$] price jump isnt bad at all. I bought Logic 6 Platinum and the upgrade price to Pro is worth it and I am very glad that I did NOT buy the seperate instruments. If you already did, then the upgrade might not be as worth it. I can't find too much info on what else is new or improved with this version. Logic may have a learning curve, but once you learn it inside and out, it's probably the most powerful Audio/MIDI package available. If only audio is your primary concern and you want something simple, then ProTools should be considered. But if you want total control over everything, then Logic is the way to go. Id say Logic for composers and more complex music, and ProTools for bands looking to record. Logic is also compatible with TDM hardware systems.	2004-02-26

It's so much faster to just transcribe by hand.  I did train quite a bit and used clear audio files with no background noise  If the Scribe transcriptions  were 60% right AND there was a decent editor that allowed you to get the job done faster, it would not have been a complete waste.  It's the lame editing capabilities that makes it a total waste.  For example, Scribe gives me about 15 options of one segment of audio.  It's faster to type than go through all Scribe's choices looking for the best.  OK, so I don't look through the long list.  I choose the first and edit so it's correct.  That could be useful, BUT when the user edits this segment Scribe erases the audio corresponding to that that segment of text so the user can't play the audio again to double check.  This was a total waste.  There's a reason there's no trial version.  No one would buy it if there were. Oh yeah,you'd think they'd allow standard flash video input (.flv) but it doesn't.  I used excellent freeware to extract the audio it needed for Scribe.	2010-04-21

I loved most things about the older version and thought this would be a great new investment. Boy was I wrong.    First of all I didn't realize it was actually a DVD and not CD when I purchased it. Yes, my computer is that old. Fortunately Hallmark has a trade in program so I just sent them the DVD and they sent me back four CD's. I installed them with no problem but when I went to print out the cards I discovered that the pictures on the front didn't print out. The letters and borders printed, but no darn picture! So anytime I wanted to print a card I had to print a test page first on cheap paper to see if it would even work. After four tries with different cards and only one printing out the picture I gave up. Now I am going online to Amazon to see if I can find an older version like what I had because I never had any problems with it.    Update: I contacted Hallmark Customer Service about the problem I was having and this was the response they gave me:    Thank you for contacting Hallmark.    The Card/Scrapbook Studio software was created by the Sierra Company and is sold at office supply stores and other retailers that sell computer software. Creative Homes has acquired the software that Sierra had created, including servicing consumers who had purchased the Card/Scrapbook Studio software made by Sierra.    The Card/Scrapbook Studio includes Hallmark's artwork, but it is not a Hallmark product.  We have no information about the product itself. For technical support or other inquiries for this product, please go to [...] or call 1-818-222-7200.    For Creative Homes customer service, please call 818-591-9600.    We apologize we are not able to give you the type of service you expected.    ???????? Why do they have their name on a product that they can't help me with? Last time I ever buy a Hallmark product.LATEST UPDATE:  If you would like to know what has happened since please read the comments under this review. At this point I would have to say that if you encounter the same problem I had with pictures not printing, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, download the updated printer drives recommended by Hallmark (especially if you have a Dell V505 printer). You are better off either getting another printer, or giving the software away. Believe me it would be A LOT CHEAPER than the money lost by purchasing this software and save you many hours of agony!!!!!!.	2010-03-28

I was sure I had most of the photos backed up but I knew the videos did not back up to photo stream so I was actually quite upset that I lost what was no more than 50 or 100 pictures and videos. That night I went online and downloaded a couple of Data recovery services but they didn't work so well. I didn't purchase them but when the option came up to recover them it was not easy-to-understand understand. I was then advised to try data rescue 3. For me it was simply a goal of getting the library back. I currently use a Macbook RP 15 inch with 16 gigs of memory and a 512 SSD so I thought the file is gone.<br /><br />When I went on to the data rescue website I need to buy the version from the website as the version on the app store will not work with the operating system (its 40 more but worth it). The thing that was most interesting to me was there was a telephone number for tech support which is almost impossible to find today. If you do find it you're generally on hold for a long time before you can get somebody on the phone and then it's generally not very helpful. Somebody picked up within one minute of dialing and told me exactly what I needed to do. i bought  software for $99 understanding there was no refund if it didn't work although the initial search that didn't include recovery did show my library in the tree as well as it being a 60 gig file so I was comfortable that this work. I accidentally downloaded the wrong software from the company for $99 and when I called the guy up asking how to run what i thought was the right software I downloaded he immediately gave me a proper serial number even though that was my mistake and there're no refunds on the software. That left me with a very good feeling to begin with. Then I run the software on my library and I was done. Complete and intact it restored it to my hard drive and I can't be happier. If you delete something try not to use your hard drive as I learned because he can overwrite the files by this software and use it. The photos were my three children many graduation pictures I thank you very much for such an incredible piece of software. I live in NJ and work in the financial industry - I'm not a robo reviewer - this is the real deal and a real heartfelt review. thanks guys.	2014-06-26

If you have an older version you have to do a complete uninstall and you may have to do a manual unistall and watch out for your registry files, before you even begin to start thinking about updating.  After installing the software I could not access the internet so I had to uninstall it just to get online to chat support person or I could spend $... a minute for advice over the phone in addition to long distance charges, that's right no toll free number. after trying to install the upgade 7 times with various instructions that was sure to solve my problem the each time.  I finally got it installed and running.  McAfee really has a customer service problem with their techs mine kept telling me to do the same thing over and over.

This is very powerful product for the price and compatible with the full version costing thousands more.  You don't get 3D, cannot write programs for LT and I don't think you can link elements to a database.  My favorite AutoCAD tools are the new array command which helps you layout offices in a fraction of the time.  Not to mention dynamic crosshatch.  I try to master copy, modify, trim, extend, mirror and array commands so I can crank out drawings.  Osnaps also reduce drawing times.  You can pretty much do just about anything you want in a few mouse clicks.  BTW - 3d is also awesome, but it does not work in LT (you can draw in perspectives in LT but they are not really 3D).  If you're consultant, between jobs or just want to advance your career, I'd recommend trying one of the SofTutor products for 3D [[ASIN:1929491352 Teacher inside of AutoCAD 3D (for version 2012)]] you can get a free 30 day demo copy of the full version of AutoCAD from Autodesk's website ... although probably after you master LT.	2011-11-08

Like others it conflicts with CD software, sometimes does not load on start-up, does not auto update, etc etc etc.  It is a real problem you have Symantec when you try to sell us this dodgy software then get one of your people to write a 5 star reviews (see other (one) review).

I bought this software when I was pregnant.  Don't remember where, but the sticker says I paid 1.99 for it.  Would pay a million times that for the joy this has brought my daughter.  She started at 18 months when we gave her an old pc we had in the garage.  Of all the software we had this was the only stuff she could use without instruction or assistance from an adult; and for a kid stuck on independence that is a big deal.  Her favorite for a time was the Follow Me Theater because even when she did nothing Reader would come out every so often and do a song.  Now she manipulates the mouse to do whatever she wants.  She has also developed great letter, color, and animal recognition, as well as being able to name tons of objects she has seen on the letter train.  Top this all off with the fact that we are frequently treated to her sweet renditions of the Follow Me Theater songs and you know why we love it so much.  We have purchased the Reader Rabbit's Preschool and Reader Rabbit's Kindergarten and plan to give one for easter and one for her birthday in July.  Can't wait to see all the fun she has with those.	2005-03-23

I'm upgrading to X6 from X5 [[ASIN:B008MR2GKA PaintShop Pro X5  Ultimate]] which I gave a very favorable review.<br /><br />The biggest reason to upgrade to this new version, X6, is the 64-bit performance. It may, actually, be the only reason to upgrade now if you have X5 or X4 unless one of the added points of functionality is critical to use (some added RAW processing, mainly). I wanted the 64-bit because I do very large files and will have a dozen open at one time. X6 will speed this up for me, and keep more stability.<br /><br />At this point, there are really only a couple things I go to Photoshop for anymore, versus PaintShopPro. One is right justified text - Photoshop does, PaintShopPro does not. There's a few image filters, too, which I like on Photoshop. Other than that... if you're looking for does-almost-it-all image processing, now with 64-bit performance, I recommend PaintShopPro X6.	2013-11-05

I had a some what similar program from Norton that was I think a 2003 edition. I had some hijack programs and possibly some viruses that had gotten onto my laptop so I bought the then current Norton anti-virus program. I thought it was lousy because it actually seemed to make my laptop worse. It could not remove anything and actually would cause it to freeze and I would have to reboot it. After a few times this happened I uninstalled it. I then bought Trend Micro's anti virus program and that seemed to handle everything well but I reformatted/erased my hd before I installed it. Eventually it became a cumbersome product and uninstalled it and went a few years without any kind of antivirus program.     Last year I bought an HP desktop with Windows Vista 64 from Circuit City and the techs convinced me (after a lot of arm twisting) to buy Norton's Internet Security. They told me it was the only product that would work well with Vista 64. I was skeptical because I figured they were just trying to push Norton products. Turns out they were right! Well I haven't tried any other program so I can't say for certain this one works best with Vista 64 but other than 1 irritating problem this has been a great product and stops everything dead in its tracks that attempts to compromise my pc. Okay so the irritating problem is the few times I've reformatted my hd and then installed my Norton IS it will not update to the newest version without me having to contact Norton's tech support. My copy is the 2008 version and to download the 2009 program Norton's tech support has to do it for me. If it wasn't for this I would have given it 5 stars.	2009-05-12

I asked for my money back because I was spending way too much time entering the information in (sometimes 3 times) before it would save. They simply ignored me and won't even respond. What a nightmare. I have never written a bad review before but I couldnt let this continue without writing something.

First, ROXIO's Easy CD Creator 5 was advertised to be a complete solution to backing up my computer by using a option, \\"Take Two\\". This is advertised to make a complete \\"Image\\" of my computer and place it on a CD (burner Installed) for back-up purposes. The problem, the program hangs up my computer at times...after several months after purchase, ROXIO say's, we have problems and will no longer support this feature and recomends not using it!!!<br />The next disappointing feature is used to record audio from a cassette or other external source. When one tries to enter a title of the music to be recorded (via Spin Doctor/SoundStream 2)the program hangs up my computer!!! <br />Roxio support for this product is poor...and makes me think twice about other products by this producer.

The program requires activation which I have no problem with. However the SLIGHTEST change to your computer, add or remove 1 single piece of hardware, repartion a drive etc. and the program ceases to work and requires a call to Intuit. In many cases you have to have a new CD sent to you.<br />2. The program install a piece of software called C-Dilla without asking you. This program does NOT uninstall when you uninstall TurboTax and basically requires a low-level format of your hard drive to remove. The C-Dilla program causes your CD-RW drive to slow down when it is in use, even when the TurboTax program is uninstalled... forever until your reformat!<br />3. The program cheat fair use because I like many use my laptop on the road and my desktop at home to complete my return. This is impossible now.<br />I am all for Intuit doing what it can to preserve the fair use of its software. However installing hidden software I can't remove that harms my system performance, and rendering my paid sofware impossible to use if I make a slight change to my system, and finally preventing me from having the convience of working on my return on the road... it is just to much to bear!<br />I switched to TaxCut 2002 and the program is just as good as TurboTax 2002 in terms of tax performance. In 2003 the only way TurboTax will lure me back is if the program is superior in performance to TaxCut, removes all activation systems, and finally lowers its cost to match that of TaxCut which is cheaper.	2003-01-13

This program stepped up visually and tried to simplify things but really it turned drastically in the wrong direction.  The program crashes over and over for unknown reasons, and some of the simple tricks and quick fixes that could be done on the older programs are now gone because, of course, lets simplify things and put everything in a new location.    Get this, I wanted to burn a DVD.  My specifications, simple.  I wanted to burn a movie file onto a disc and I wanted NO DVD menu and NO sound.  Sadly for me that wasn't going to happen.  You have no option, you must choose from their templates or \\"your own\\".  Basically letting you know, yea... You're going to have a DVD menu.  Secondly, audio tracks. Good God.  For one they're terrible, two you HAVE to choose background music.  Its a must for any DVD menu right!?  I tried deleting the music and it said, \\"This is currently in use so you can't delete it\\" Basically, again, telling me it has to be this way.  So I had to go to my audio editor and create a sound file that lasted 3 seconds that was complete silence. When I imported it into the thing, of course they \\"simplify\\" things, clicking doesn't work any more! You need to.... Ddrraagg itt... soo much more simple.  So once I drug the dang carcass of a file I figured alright, now I got my silence, I can live with this I guess.  No.  Before you erase the previous background music, you have to select the sound you want to use from the \\"Dragged\\" Sound files.  So once I \\"selected\\" the silence I could then delete the dang music because it was No Longer In Use.  Lastly I wanted to burn 5 of the same DVD's, NO! I gotta go through and redo the whole dang annoying process to do that! Good God, If you're going to get a video editor and/or DVD maker I recommend Ulead Video Studio 10, 11, or 12.  Not this \\"Pro\\" crap.  They just prettied up a very flawed program that is designed for simple users and no one that has any skills with the program already.    I hope I spared you of acquiring a faulty program and I hope you use the much better and older program. Have a nice day.	2011-03-31

What I  really needed was a simple program to make lead sheets for bands I play in, students<br />I teach or to share my music online. Keyword SIMPLE! I was able to manually enter notes with a mouse and keyboard or play them in using a MIDI piano/synth keyboard or my MIDI guitar controller, and it worked very well.<br />This is the first one of these programs where that input method worked without a million glitches. Awesome!<br />Functions and commands were easy to learn and the online manual is very helpful.<br />I have not used the scanning at all...mostly because my experiences with scanning sheet music in to the other older programs I have used before were a horrible waste of time. I ended up having to re-enter all the notes manually to fix a million mistakes. Just let me play the music in and that works fine. You can slow down the tempo to be more accurate and speed it up to the normal tempo when you are all entered in correctly.<br />This program does what it is supposed to for making basic sheet music you can share with others..	2013-01-18

US	46915263	RBJEIWFKJSSZT	B000096L6Z	853069964	Encarta Reference Library 2004 DVD [Old Version]	Software	5	10	10	N	N	Encarta 2004 versus Britannica 2004	I have bought both Encarta and Britannica for years (EB in printed edition too: 32 volumes, 32.000 sheets). This is my opinion in brief: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) makes interesting to buy both.<BR>TEXT: Britannica is a superb encyclopedia in text (not in visual aid) since 1768 (you know: an article by Einstein and so on...). Text in electronic version differs from printed encyclopedia (very large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more items than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like \\"Mexico\\" are only one (with a lot of subdivisions) in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are unconnected, and you must \\"jump\\" from one subdivision to another, which is slow and very annoying, especially if you want to copy it in \\"WORD\\". Very often, the text is not updated.<BR>In the other hand, Encarta's text is not bad at all. Most articles have the name of their contributors (professions, works...): They are not John Doe. You can find large fragments of literary works, literature guides, a lot of sidebars and thousands of quotations. \\"Encarta Africana\\" is included. The Pop-Up (double clicking a word) Dictionary and Thesaurus has sound for correct pronunciation (by the way, it can read aloud, with a robotic and ugly voice, a whole article). The \\"Translation Dictionaries\\" to Spanish, French, German and Italian must be improved, because they are minimal. It gives you a lot of \\"Internet links\\", even if you are not connected. With Britannica you must be \\"on-line\\" and it searches in an EB Web page.<BR>In theory you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work: You can not find new files. Encarta can be updated free EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions or corrections to the old ones (till October 2004). With Encarta updating really works. Technically, is amazing to see the changes in old items.<BR>ATLAS Britannica has not a real atlas; only a worlds map whose maximum detail is the States of USA. Statistics are very poor. Encarta's Atlas is like another encyclopedia, with a great detail (1 cm/ 4 km all over the world) and 20 types of atlas presentations (statistical ones can be counted by dozens). If you look a geographical article (city, river...) you can see in a corner where it is placed and, with only a click, open the atlas. In articles of cities, if you are on-line, you can see in another corner the weather of this place in that moment. If it is a USA place, you can read the latest news.<BR>MULTIMEDIA: They say that \\"serious\\" or \\"adult\\" readers do not care about \\"pictures\\"; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\". Works of art, anatomy, historical maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, charts & tables, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, 360-degrees views, timeline, games... It is not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated.  Britannica is not really multimedia. It has photos and videos, but they make the program slow and sluggish. They should edit an alternative version with only text, as they did with the first edition in 1995. It worked fast and easy in old computers.<BR>INTERFACE AND PERFORMANCE: This is the worst side of Britannica. With Encarta you only have to type a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you automatically alternative spellings. Even if you write the name of a small village lost in any country, you see it in the atlas. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. It has additional ways to find content, including subject or multimedia browsing, \\"related articles\\" and the standard A-Z method. The \\"Research Organizer\\" is very helpful too. Encarta's TEXT FONT is very clear (Britannica's...) and you can choose 3 sizes.<BR>Navigating with Britannica is different. 2004 edition is better than 2003 one, but still it is disappointing. I will only give you an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with similar spellings (unless you open a window and fight with it). As I said before, the program's performance speed is very slow and sluggish, and it must be dramatically improved. To go \\"back and forward\\" you do not find any icon and you need to open a \\"menu\\".... One \\"pro\\" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh.<BR>I repeat my modest piece of advice: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) make interesting to buy both.	2004-05-29

You can share files on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter.  You can easily work with Box, DropBox, GoogleDrive, SkyDrive, or an FTP site. There is support for MS Office 2013. You can add watermarks to documents and convert documents to PDF as you zip them.  You can also resize images.  Be aware that the Backup functions are only available in the Pro version of Winzip 17, not the Standard version.  Likewise the Winzip Jobs Wizard to automate repetitive processes is only available in the Pro version.<br /><br />I had a problem with adding files to an existing zip file.  I had created a new zip file and then 10 minutes later I updated a Word document and wanted to add it to that zip file.  With the zip file open in WinZip I tried to drag the Word file and drop it into the zip file.  That didn't work.  It was not intuitive how to add a file.  Then I got an error message that I didn't have permission to open the zip file, to \\"contact the file owner or administrator to obtain permission.\\"  I am the file owner and the administrator.<br /><br />Winzip 17 also says you can send up to 2 gigabytes of files with an email. However it appears that you have to sign up for the Pro version of ZipSend, which is about $10 a month.  There is a free version of ZipSend that allows you to send a 100 MB file by email, and the file is available for only 7 days.<br /><br />Winzip also claims it has \\"revamped interface with context-sensitive toolbars means you see only the tools you need.\\"  Winzip 17 has the \\"ribbon\\" menus similar to MS Office after version 2003.  I'm not a big fan of the ribbon menus.  For example, I used Winzip 17 to create an encrypted copy of my Quickbooks file on my local hard drive.  Then I wanted to place a copy of the encrypted file on my GoogleDrive.  Winzip's ribbon menu is showing the icon for my Google Drive.  But it's showing me the option to unzip that encrypted file to my GoogleDrive.  The whole purpose of my encrypting the file was to prevent anyone else from opening it.  Why would I want to unzip it to my GoogleDrive? Seems like the intuitive ribbons frequently show what I don't want and I have to hunt for the commands that I want.<br /><br />WinZip 17 was easy to install.  I uninstalled Winzip 15 and then installed Winzip 17 without any problems.  However after I installed Winzip 17 I clicked on Help | Check for Updates.  It indicated that there was an update available.  When I clicked to do the update, I got a screen saying that I could download or buy a Version Upgrade to Winzip 17.  Well I had just installed version 17, so I didn't understand why I was being shown an offer to upgrade and buy version 17.  All I wanted was an update, not an upgrade.  I went ahead and clicked on the download and installed it and it did update my version 17 to a later version of 17.<br /><br />One of my previous criticisms of an earlier version of WinZip (version 15) was the way it moved files to an encrypted zip file.  Turns out that after Winzip moved the file(s) to the zip files, Winzip deleted the original files to the Windows recycle bin. This made the files available to be undeleted later.  That was bad.  WinZip has now fixed that problem.  However Winzip fixed the problem by removing the Move command.  Now you can only add files, you can't move them.	2013-05-14

Ad-Aware was once the #1 free anti-malware program to use. People would always recommend using this and \\"Spy Bot Search and Destroy\\". However, after a while, the programs kept getting bigger in megabytes with each version, but also was declining from keeping up to date with the latest malware and other things that effect your internet usage.<br /><br />People may still recommend these two programs to you, but what they are unaware of is that Ad-Aware is just not like it used to be. As more variations of things that infect your computer came, the more your chances of Adware detecting the problem decreased. I found myself being infected, even using both Adware, and Spybot, with AVG, things where getting through and infecting my computer, yet none of these programs could detect a thing. Your only options where to either figure out what was causing the problem, and google it, in hopes somewhere it had been discussed how to remove the problem, or you could sit back for months at time before Ad-Aware finally downloaded an update that searches for the file that is giving you problems... that is, unless of coarse you had a virus that would not even allow you to get on the net, or at least search the net... but your best option, look for a better program.<br /><br />Ad-aware has been a program I am sad to see go, as it did used to once be a great program that was up-to-date and cleaned your computer well of the nasty little things that can get in there. But it's also been one of those programs that has just constantly gone up and down with it's updates; sometimes it was good, sometimes it was useless, but for today's usage, you need something that is well maintained and not just filled with \\"give us money\\" junk all over it.<br /><br />Updating from the free version of Ad-Aware to the pay version makes no difference. At this point in time, I highly recommend \\"MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware\\" program. You only need the free version, and it was able to detect about 300 or more filesthe first time I used it, and that IS 300 or more files that SpyBot and Ad-Aware where not detecting, so if you do the math, thats why I recommend that program over Ad-Aware or the others at this point in time.<br /><br />p.s: seeing as how there is no listing for spy-bot S&D; I no longer recommend that program due to it being rather unstable now. When it was a simple little program in it's early days, it was great. Then they added a whole heap of annoying little bits and peaces that may have sounded like a good thing to have, like real time protection and what not, but it also meant the program caused your computer to start up slower, and would annoy you with pop-ups like \\"spybot blocked this element, pat me on the back for it\\". It would also slow down internet speeds and again, in the end, malicious files broke through, and installed something that rendered SpyBot useless. The day I took off both Adaware and Spybot, and replaced it with Malware Bytes program, my computers start up time and how long it took for my internet browser to display the 1st time after booting increased a heck of a lot.	2010-08-15

The program is likely to be ok except for one thing.  You can not make any changes to your computer.  I loaded it and then made the mistake of turning on my external hard drive where my PDF files are stored and the problem started. I called customer support, which was a real treat and was finally told to do a clean insall.  This time I left the external hard drive on and it went alright.  A few days later I inserted a USB drive into my computer and guess what, problems again.  The program thinks everytime another drive is added that you are trying to load it onto a second computer. I got it on sale so I didn't loose a lot of money, but once you open the box and load it there is no returning it to the store.  If I'd purchased it at Amazon, I would have been able to send it back. Until they resolve this problem, I would recommend that you purchase something else. I actually ended up purchasing Corel PDF Fusion which works fine and doesn't have this activation issue.	2011-11-15

I was able to capture, edit and burn a 20 min DVD complete with video effects, audio dubbing, photo slide shows and DVD menus - DVD played with stunning clarity on two dvd players without any problems. Excellent product for the price I paid (nothing - came bundled with the dvd burner). However, when I attempted to burn an hour long video, all the hell started breaking loose.     1. Despite saving the project, storyboard/timeline does not remember all the clips and transitions added to the movie. I'd to repeat this cumbersome and time consuming process every time.    2. I think as the # of clips grow (not 100% sure, Arcsoft is yet to get back to me), I started getting an error. Tried several alternatives but no avail. No word from the online tech support after 3 days.     I gave up and now am using MS Windows Movie Maker for the editing purpose. Will still use the DVD Maker portion of Arcsoft.    This is a great product for amateurs/prosumers (especially for the price you pay). Too bad that the support sucks. There knowledge base is very primitive and almost good for nothing.      UPDATE: After a week, I still haven't heard from the technical support. I have switched to MS Movie Maker for now and considering to buy a different product with real support.	2005-08-26

I am a serious amatuer who has thousands of digital images that have never been catagorized or edited (half of them Raw and half or them Jpegs). My wife has always edited with Photoshop, starting with Photoshop 1. She is a MAC user and won't even consider working on a PC unless she has to.  I have always used PCs; never had a MAC.  She started using the beta of Lightroom when it was first made available.  She would always tell me how good it was and I would ask, what does it do that Photoshop, doesn't?  I never got a convincing answer but when Lightroom 2 came out and she was using it on our most recent trip, I decided I would put the trial edition on my Laptop and was blown away at the start.  I've always thought Photoshop was a little difficult and tedious.  Photography is not my day job and I don't have time to work  an hour on an image to get it \\"just right\\".  Lightroom is so easy to use and intuitive that it makes Photoshop necessary only for alterations of the images.  Plain editing can be done in a snap; things like exposure, white balance, sharpening, spot removal are all able to be adjusted within seconds.  Marking the photos, sorting them, captioning and catagorizing is all easy and accessable with a few mouse movements.    As soon as the trial was about to expire, I bought the full program and stopped griping that it was just a big Photoshop Plug-in and shouldn't cost $300.  In fact, it's a better program in a lot of ways than Photoshop and Adobe is entitled to the bucks for developing it.	2009-02-10

It's also the easiest for non-accountants to screw up. Therein lies the problem. QuickBooks does not teach you accounting. It provides you with a framework to keep track of your records. When it's set up and maintained correctly, it provides a business owner with tons of valuable data on the health of your business. I recommend QuickBooks very highly but I suggest that business owner's get help from a pro when they're setting up their company. I have spent numerous billable hours cleaning up poorly set up companies. Although that's great for MY business, it's not good for yours. It's much cheaper for you to start out with the right framework and training. Understanding the numbers side of your business is crucial to your success but don't expect a software program to be the magic bullet that teaches you everything you need to know. QuickBooks is a great tool and all my regular clients use it most successfully with a little help from their friendly accountant.	2002-11-11

And since I am the owner of my home-based business with little to no income most of the time because of the software costs...well, purchasing upgrades is not always something I can do. My point coming to this....you really need to evaluate your goals and desires before purchasing costly programs in the digital artistry field. I have yet to find great software that isn't expensive. And if you expect to find a fantastic manual with your software then 9 times out of 10 you'll never see it. Corel Painter, any version really, have all been fantastic and they continue to improve but if you're just starting out and your funds are limited or you are not a professional and you just want to play or have a side hobby then buy an older version, a used copy, or look for company specials, and save yourself some money. Painter is an awesome program and there are no two ways about it. My recommendation to you simply:<br /><br />If you are not a serious artist, you do it as a hobby, or maybe you are a student, then get an older version, a used copy, a company special or a student rate when you purchase your copy of painter. Next, don't expect anything from the manual you  may or may not get depending on your purchase choice. Concentrate on buying a book later on that specializes in Painter. There are some terrific books out there from student to hobbiest to professional.<br /><br />If you are a professional then I don't need to tell you anything that you didn't already know. Painter is a fantastic program and coupled or grouped with other programs such as Photoshop, you can let your creativity soar.<br /><br />Last, don't bad mouth a product because of your own nievity. Dont' cry because Corel decided to create a program that was awesome and it didn't fit in with your budget...you have choices you can make it's just a matter of making good ones based on your needs. Do your homework and think about what your goals are. If you want to spend a lot of money but can't then save up for it if it's that important to you. Believe me when I tell you...Corel has done no wrong here.it in with your budget...you have choices you can make it's just a matter of making good ones based on your needs.

US	36770421	RTX97IWYRK1FL	B0001AU6IK	220659399	Pinnacle Studio 9 AV/DV	Software	3	16	17	N	Y	Good Product, Bad Tech Support, Marginal Manual	I have to say that the product does work. In fact, it works pretty well, but because the manual doesn't really cover a lot of the basic problems in setting up the card and the program, I recommend caution in buying this product. If you have computer knowledge and certain degree of perseverance, this is for you. If you get intimidated by changing windows system settings, monkeying around in your device manager and cleaning your registry, you might want to think twice. <br />On the plus side, the firewire capture worked very well the first time and its pretty easy to do. The analog capture is more difficult to get figured out, but it works well too once you're set up correctly. You'd better have a lot of hard drive space - like an extra 20 gig for a 90 minute video. <br />I had to contact technical support on a couple of relatively minor issues and found out that technical support is pretty bad. You can get support via email (you need to have your serial number handy to do this). I don't recommend going this route, however, because it's a 24 hour turn-around for each question and response. And the responses are awful -- just quotes from the manual. &quot;Make sure all background programs are closed.&quot; &quot;Make sure your chipset drivers are updated.&quot; &quot;Make sure you defrag your hard drive...&quot; It goes on and on. And they won't give you a substantive answer until you promise you have done all of the &quot;stock&quot; things that the manual already tells you to do. I'm on day 4 with email tech support over a green line that showed up on one of my captured videos. The tech support person keeps giving me one more little &quot;task&quot; to do before he will address the issue of why there is a line on one video capture but not others. Email support is abysmal in its helpfulness. <br />Telephone support, on the other hand, isn't bad. I would like to give you the technical support telephone number, but its against Amazon's rules.  That's a shame, I could have saved you 20 minutes because that's how long it will take you to find it. From what I can tell you get your first call free and they want $30 for all subsequent calls. Ouch! That hurts, especially when the manual doesn't tell you how to actually capture video using the S-video connector. (You've got to make a change to a setting at an odd place in the software and its not addressed in the manual or in the help file that comes with the product.) <br />My bottom line is that the product works, but you have to be ready to take your lumps on the technical support side. I've transferred a couple of home videos from MiniDV format as well as a kid's vhs tape for use as a svcd. I'm happy with both. Now that I'm past the initial learning curve, I hope I can enjoy the product more. If you're the faint of heart type or don't have a bunch of computer experience, this product is probably not for you. Once its up and running you're fine, but there is a lot of &quot;tweaking&quot; required to get to that point and you can't expect much help from Pinnacle.	2004-04-23

I purchased a new laptop from DELL who also sells and recommends this software for migrating your applications to the new machine. I had an old XP laptop and used this to move my software onto the new XP laptop. This took the better part of a day after which the USB ports on the new laptop ceased to function. Also, only about 20% of the applications transferred ran on the new laptop. I still had to manually intervene to get my e-mail working properly as only about 30% of my old e-mails were transferred over at all.  I spent almost 2 days with DELL trying everything to resurrect the USB ports (no tech support from LapLink on a holiday weekend thank you). I have high praise for the technical skill and professionalism at DELL support, sadly that isn't enough to undo the damage PCmover wrought.  Thankfully a system restore brought functionality back to my new laptop but that's after three days of wasted effort and I'm back to square one with software migration.	2009-07-06

I mean seriously, how hard can it be? Well, they were right, it sucks. It took me two hours to get it all working.    My advice: Don't even install the app from the included disc. Instead, just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and ALL the patches for the modules that come with it.    My experience:    1) Try to install from disc. Fails with a 1308.  2) Google'd the problem. Found out I needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there.  3) Downloaded the ~650 MB ZIPPED installer. Then, I had to unzip the 18,000 files, which took about 20 minutes on my PC.  4) I was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install.  5) Then I had to jump through one final hoop to active it (take this key copy it here, then copy this here, stand on your head, etc..).

Office2010 and Outlook2010 can NOT nor ever be outdone.<br />Microsoft came out with this version as Microsoft Office and Outlook2007, I started using both at the office, then they came out with Office2010 and Outlook2010 which I.T. at work installed both on my office PC and my Office laptop...I fell in love with it.<br />--<br />Trust me 100% when I say the crap today Office & Outlook2013 is garbage and same with Office365 both are a waste of time and money.  Those two programs function and look like something children (5th graders) would use in a school class room, Pure garbage, Office2013 and Outlook2013 and Office365 are absolutely in NO WAY professional nor should they ever be used in a professional environment nor in a  professional manner.<br />--<br />Until Microsoft id10T's get off their wacky drugs and childish goofy ideas and start working on ways to develop real and professional programs again...  I will stay with Office2010 & Outlook2010 regardless if it has any issues of any kind. I.T. at work say's Microsoft no longer supports Office-Outlook2010, but most of us at the office continue to run it as does the I.T. dept.  Now that alone should tell you something. Oh FYI- Office2010 does work well with Windows 8.1 which is my current system and it works just perfect.	2014-12-02

I love hockey games, I have too many, and this is one that I have always wanted but never got because my computer could not run it when it came out. Biggest reason in 2014 why I acquired it? Well the sound design is absolutely stellar. And I love the strange transition from 3D they were making in this time in gaming. The detailed 2D sprites on a 3d rink and attention to detail are amazing. It certainly made me wonder if you could do a couple more years of this hybrid, what it would look like? I also thought FIFA 96 was awesome in this era. But the games plays like 94 with updated graphics. Players move the same, the passing is hit and miss (as it should be) A lot of bounces with the puck and penalties to be had. The UI is impressive and like I said, the original soundtrack really put this game on the map and was really the beginning of a stellar couple of years, NHL98 and 99 being the pinnacle of the design. Before falling into mediocrity and rising again with the fantastic play of NHL 04. But yes not for everyone. A good game of hockey, with brilliant presentation and sound design. The playability is also familiar and the inclusion of double minors make this game a solid package. Biggest knock about it is the speed of play and the puck is like as big as a frisbee out there. Goalies are also pretty bad and don't offer excitement on chances, it's more like a wait and see when you shoot. You shoot the puck and you hear it bounce everywhere and then GOAL! All in all NHL 96 is what I expected. NHL 94 with the aesthetic of those 96 games and some little things that seperate it.  Also it's a must to play in High Res mode. Fun game all in all.	2014-07-23

They have a wonderful collection of images or you can scan and create from your on designs or photographs.  It offers a wide variety of stitch options along with patterns for looms.  The delica bead library is updated when necessary and you can change the bead variations to include a wide range of colors for your design or delete any colors you feel are not necessary.  Bead Creator offers on-line tutorials or you can buy a software manual (which I did).  I also became a life-time member which gives free upgrades for the life of the software.  This option has already paid for itself.  I am very pleased with this program and highly recommend it.	2011-09-30
US	52971035	R3FDV5GDJT32G1	B0001EKE6U	319912800	RoboHelp Office X5	Software	1	6	6	N	N	Functions like a Beta release	Want support for JavaHelp? Forget it. RoboHelp claims to support JavaHelp, but only supports some of it.  <br /> <br />For example, I had to write a utility to \\"massage\\" the resulting JavaHelp build xml files because RoboHelp does not recognize multiple controls pointing to a single JavaHelp topic. (No, aliases do not work for JavaHelp.)  <br /> <br />Also, neither JavaHelp 1.x nor 2.x recognizes all the formatting codes inserted by RoboHelp. For example, plain old HTML bold tags display properly; RoboHelp's bold style does not. What's the use of using a style then? <br /> <br />Did this company even test the product? I don't think so. In fact, when I used one of my two \\"freebie\\" support tickets to force the issue about the multiple control/single topic issue, Macromedia admitted, after sending me a lot of irrelevant material about using aliases, that this was a known bug and there were no plans to fix it.  <br /> <br />Want frustrating error-prone version control? Just use RoboHelp's built-in crash-a-rama RoboSource, the program that continually provides errors. Oh, I can get it working, sometimes even for days at a stretch; then it'll start its crashing again, where I have to repeatedly reboot my server, a machine we've had to dedicate to RoboSource. RoboHelp doesn't work with CVS, the version control system we use inhouse, though Macromedia claims it works with SourceSafe. I'll never know, though, because I've learned over the years not to trust Macromedia. <br /> <br />Want support for Eclipse? Forget about it. Doesn't exist.  <br /> <br />Perhaps for users who only need to single-source a simple documentation set, such as a WinHelp system coupled with a Word document, this product would work just fine. I'll never know, because the documentation community should be heading in the same direction as the application community: cross-platform compatibility. <br /> <br />I could list other problems and workarounds, but what's the point? I recommend looking elsewhere,depending on your documentation needs. I know I will.  <br /> <br />The next sound you hear will be the installation CDs hitting my trash can, and the tapping of my keys as I take this opportunity to find another product....	2005-03-29

The compression program is easy enough to understand and navigate; as good as any other I've used. What makes WinZip 18 stand out and well worth the money is that this new version is bundled with several other features and programs that I thought would have to purchased separately. Included is a pdf file-maker, a photo editing feature and a cloud navigation feature. Installation and operation of the program (s) is quick and easy; operation is much faster than I remember with older versions of Winzip. I definitely recommend this anyone shopping for a compression program, you get a lot of bang for your buck with this one.	2014-03-20

Adobe has had multiple security breaches on their website which lost customer's credit card data and now the only way that we can order updates is by giving Adobe our credit card data???? I don't think so!! Adobe simply has too much competition in this area to continue to deal with them. Products like CaptureOne Pro and the new (free) Affinity Photo are becoming very popular alternatives to LR.<br /><br />LR Mobile is basically a crippled version of the desktop so not much to get excited about there. Might as well get a laptop and use the much better Mac/Windows version if I need to go mobile and doing that won’t require any subscription service.<br /><br />Update: Before I wrote this review I was told by THREE Adobe employees that Lightroom was not available for purchase by 3rd party stores. After writing this review a couple of commenters told me that you can order through PayPal on adobe.com. I am not sure what is going on. If the LR6 upgrade is available at 3rd party stores then why are MULTIPLE employees telling me it isn’t available from the 3rd party. Frankly I don’t even want to give Adobe my email address since you know you are going to get a million emails a day nagging you to move off LR6 and over to Creative Cloud just like how Adobe nags you with web banners when you browse the internet. No thank you.<br /><br />If anyone needs the update to LR6 and doesn't want to join CC type the following into Google: Here is the direct link to download/upgrade the standalone version of Adobe Lightroom 6	2015-04-23

I migrated to AVID STUDIO - great!, and then Pinnacle 16 Ult. (it is an upgraded AVID). Apart from the \\"black on black\\" desktop, which I find hard to see, especially the sliders-why, why??? I find the program very easy to use, and it runs well on my machine. Word of advise to those who suffer lock-ups:<br />Get a good system, and learn how to use NLE's! I use a Gigabyte MoBo Intel i7 2.9 GHz CPU, 8Gb RAM, GeForce 240GT GPU 1Gb RAM, but could probably go to a GT570 series for smoother previews. 2 x LG DVD burners (good for copying) OS = WIN 7 Pro 64 bit. 2 x HDD's 500Gb, 1 x External 1Tb storage. I would like to go to a much \\"bigger\\" system, but funds prohibit this. However, I do quite well with this arrangement.<br /><br />Keep the system cool!!!! I recently experienced faulty burning, auto-shutdowns etc, when processing large video. I opened the case to find that the CPU (Processor) fan, and the GPU fan and heatsinks were completely blocked with dust! When I dismantled the CPU from its heatsink, I found the silicon compound completely dry and powdered. After cleaning every thing up, I re-applied the silicon, and re-assembled. I also cleaned the case cooling fans which were also clogged with dust and fibres. I originally picked up the problem when checking the BIOS for system health, and discovered the CPU temp was over 90 deg C. (Not good!)[[ASIN:B008U5EL5C Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate]]<br /><br />In looking at my own experiences over many years of computer use (I started in the mid 80's)and photography, movies, video etc., I have found most complaints are generated by those with inadequate systems, understanding of the equipment, and knowledge of product and processes etc. Somethings are simply not that easy - like trying to be a brain surgeon without going through the training.<br /><br />I have made many travel docs, info DVD's and promos etc, without too many problems. Sometimes, to get what you want, you need to spend money - as they say, you only get what you pay for. Hope this is of help to someone.	2013-04-04

This is the first time I have used Money and find that it has some major problems particulary in respect of managing special investment activities such as Splits, Spin-offs and mergers, etc. The following details some of the problems faced during my usage. <br /> <br />1. First and foremost problem is the inability to correct any mistakes while entering the transaction. For example if a split is entered then the program automatically adjusts the number of  shares and the cost basis. However there will neither be a record of this action in the Account nor any way to delete or reverse it.  <br /> <br />2. Most surprisingly even if the entire transactions of that particular equity is deleted and reentered it will not allow the re-entry of the split on that particular date. The program will return a dialog stating that A SPLIT EXISTS ON THAT DATE. One can perhaps get around it by using a different date for the split but imagine re-entering all transactions including any dividends received etc. It becomes a NIGHTMARE. <br /> <br />3. Money does handle Splits, Spin-offs and Mergers nicely if the data is entered correctly the very first time. But God forbid if a mistake is made. THERE IS NO WAY TO REVIEW, CORRECT OR RE-ENTER the data.  <br /> <br />Money also has very poor report creating functionality. To create a report for any other dates than year ends requires some efforts.  <br /> <br />The Customer Support tries hard to be helpful but they seem to lack either the expertise or the knowledge to redress any problems like mentioned above. They probably have sufficient knowledge and experience to guide customers through basic features but they are completely at sea when it comes to some complicated transactions such as mentioned above. <br /> <br />At the end is Consumer Be Warned is probably true!! <br /> <br />	2006-05-01

The update process takes about half an hour and it slows my not-too-old computer to a halt.  <br />- Spawns many processes that use up all my computer's memory. If I look at the task manager when my computer is slow, I see eight or more IHS processes running (80-120k), most of which are the largest programs running. I have attempted to give them a low priority, but it doesn't help. <br />- I think it is just a poorly developed program. I can close Outlook but IHS never shuts down. Great big program running all the time doing nothing but eating up my computer memory. If it were well behaved, I would think it would shut itself down with Outlook. <br />- Supposed to put people I send mail to in the \\"friends\\" list and that doesn't work ever, at all. <br />- Whenever I upgraded, I would have problems and the nice support people would tell me to cclean out all my saved filters so I would have to start all over. <br />- Those saved filters seem to eventually confuse themselves, so you can't just accummulate them because once they stop working, then the whole program gets confused, keeps spam and quarantines the good stuff. <br />- The program bounces mail back but the work that demands of my computer is huge and really slows things down. I can't figure out how to turn that bounce off. <br />I've pointed out these issues to their support and they tell me to reinstall, but that hasn't worked the two times I've tried it. So, I've given up on IHS. Too bad. <br />	2007-03-19

' NOT TO BE CONFUSED' with the very good ''MICROSOFT DIGITAL IMAGING SUITE EDITOR 2006'. All Microsoft and Apple Operating Systems come with their own version of a 'Picture Folder' where a person may store their  photos after they scan them into their computer. Therefore, The Microsoft Digital Imagine Standard 2006 is useless. On the other hand,  'MICROSOFT DIGITAL IMAGINING SUITE EDITOR 2006 'is great software for any serious beginner or middle of the road photo repair. Like most Microsoft software Pop-ups informs the student what to do next. So you can always read the in-depth directions & rely on the suggestions given by the program. 'Adobe Photoshop CS Extended' is the GOLD standard but CS Extended breaks the bank. CS Extended is over $1000.00. It also requires a computer dedicated to Extended Software only.  because like most I also own the top drawer requires a better computer than I own.  novice  For people who want a storage program you can pay less.	2014-12-25

Delivery from Amazon was very slow - about 9 business days -  especially as compared to past deliveries.    The Intuit phone-in registration process is frustrating, if not grueling.  They require much more information than appears to be either necessary or appropriate.  Based on past issues with updates, customer service and technical support, this time around I would have purchased a competitive product if I had found one that that was compatible with Quickbooks files and had companion tax program product similar to Turbotax Corporate.    The physical product itself (DVD Version) installed easily. Over the eight years that I've been using Quickbooks products, I really can't say I've ever had any complaints about the product's features, stability or user friendliness.  It's just that when it comes time to update (corrupted downloads) or upgrade (phone registration), it can be a an exasperating experience.  [[ASIN:B002KINCSW QuickBooks Pro 2010]]	2010-02-10

If you want to get creative and build a barrel roof you are out of luck. If you want a round concrete home like a monolithic dome with a half sphere roof...no go. I have had three versions of this program over the years and it amazes me that they seem to take away rather than add to the design features. I know my oldest, cheapo, Home Designer had a simple barn-like roof and a slanted roof you could just click on. Now you have to do 5 steps to achieve the slanted and I couldn't make the barrel roof I wanted at all. I've always wanted to combine a steel barrel roof with a container home...can't do it with this and I don't even think their full program  can do it. The roof is a general pain...it even auto assigns a roof to the first floor and it you click ceiling you auto get a roof...What if I want a deck above??? You have to remove the roof regardless of what you are doing on the second floor unless it is an exact copy of the size of the bottom floor. That gets old.  Yet, this is by far one of the better products for everyday use. I really wish they would add a few perks for the younger designer who doesn't want to live in a McMansion.	2014-03-15

It would not load properly so I called Cust Service (India) and it took half an hour and I gave up.  I waited a few days and called again and this time it loaded but it was unable to locate me -- the rep said that I must be in a location where the locator could not find a satellite.  So I took it on the road.  Unfortunately it couldn't locate me in WA, OR nor CA.  The software showed me to be somewhere in Missouri.  I didn't even try to call India again -- I just returned it.

Many people have trouble with change, particularly with a product that is used as frequently as MS Office programs.  I'm sure many of us could use our current version blindfolded.  So when menus/icons/things change it definitely disrupts our lives at first.  Once I got over the initial \\"Where the heck did that go????\\" and \\"AauahahaaaAAAAA!\\"  I found quite a few things I liked.    My favorite of the changes:    - Paste Options: (Keep Source Formatting, Merge Formatting, or Keep Text Only).  Many times I am cutting and pasting info off the internet into an email in Outlook or a Word Doc and the formatting comes out a mess.  It used to take much too long to fix it.  Now when you paste something into Word you can choose one of the aforementioned options and preview how each option will look prior to clicking \\"Paste.\\"  Brilliant!    - Right-Clicking on Text in Word and Outlook: You can now select a variety of formatting options without having to seek it out on the tool bar (change font, font size, indents, bold, italics, underline, highlight, font color, etc.)  That tool bar can only hold so many icons.    - Format Picture has greatly improved in both Outlook and Word.  I use Word rather than Publisher to make fliers or other picture heavy documents for work (when I want to do something quick and dirty).  There are so many options now to change the clip art or pictures taken from the internet that I now find myself using it at home for projects rather than going to one of my more specialized programs. (Examples: Artistic effects, soften/sharpen, saturation, tone, etc.)    - Powerpoint videos are much easier/smoother to add in and more options to manipulate as well.    - Outlook Quick Steps: I, like many, find myself doing the same thing to one email after another (moving an email to another folder mostly).  I am on a few LISTSERVs and don't always have time to read them but want them marked as read and moved into a folder I will get to during some down time (ha!).  Now with one click using Quick Steps I can mark the email as read and instantly move it into a predetermined folder.  It is nice to not have to use multiple steps to get there and waste time.  I also don't like seeing them clogging up my inbox so Quick Steps works well for me.     As far as One Note or Excel, I don't use these in my day-to-day (well... I only use Excel for basics) so I feel as though I can't comment on the changes as well as another reviewer but if you are looking for a great upgrade to Word, Outlook and Powerpoint, I would recommend this product.    Just go into it with an open mind... change is hard sometimes and patience is key.  This too will become as intuitive as Office 2003 once was to you.  You never know... you may love the new additions as much as I do (seriously.... the Paste Options Preview is worth the upgrade for my needs by itself).	2011-01-26

A friend recommended BHG Home Designer.  It was easy to install, and within an hour we had a plan of our current kitchen down to the tile floor and cabinet woodgrain.  We drew four walls, made a 3D view, and then were able to add and resize cabinets, appliances, windows, and lights.  The best thing was that my wife and I can sit down together and design different kitchens, save and modify them later.  Next, I am going to model my entire home and test different exterior paint colors.  I understand that the landscaping tools are just as good as the home design tools.  I can't wait to use them.   The best $80.00 that I have spent in a long time!	2003-12-21

It wouldn't activate - contacted support and they supplied me with a new serial / key - solved that problem.    Next problem - it would not clone ANY drive on the machine - USB, IDE, SATA didn't matter, it simply would not work.

I wish Amazon would allow us to give negative stars. I am not happy that I have to give it one star. I bought this product to copy hard drives on systems that have a UEFI BIOS. The product worked okay for the first month, and I was able to make copies even though the &#34;estimated time&#34; was always a joke. Anyway it did work the first month or 2. They I started to get errors when trying to copy hard drives, and I re-installed the software and it started to work again. Another few weeks go past and now the re-install will not even fix the problem. So if you go to the Acronis website to look for help, you have the option to PAY for help or upgrade to TrueImage 2015, but again you will pay for the upgrade. I have not idea if the TrueImage 2015 is any good, but I will not deal with TrueImage/Acronis again.	2015-01-22

I am used to MONEY, a program that had its faults, but Quicken Premier 2010 would be better called Quirky 2010.  It does not seem to be as straight forward and simple as MONEY.  Try to enter investments wherein one does not want to go back a zillion months to the first monthly investment in a given stock.  You will need the help menu to do it, and it may not help much.  Try to get the accumulated cost of the monthly investments made in the stock in the past entered.  It wants to deduct the cost from the associated cash account.    Many of the screens give only specified options.  Editing transactions can be a chore.  It is hard to edit a transaction in an investment account in the register.  Nope, you have to go to a special screen that isn't friendly.    I have not given up hope, but working with this program takes patience and plenty of it.  So don't imagine it is going to be a breeze working with it.  You will need time to get adjusted to all of the little quirks in it.    While Microsoft will no longer support MONEY beyond a certain date, who knows how long Intuit will survive to support Quicken Premier.    Good Luck!	2009-12-03

The upgraded program itself works wonderfully. What ruined the upgrade for me was the Quicken Web app.  It was a buggy two month long exercise to get the web app running and then reporting when introduced for Quicken 2013.  Last half of 2013 was problem free.  Upgrading to the 2014 web app was a complete disaster, which after two weeks, now mostly works, but I had to completely reset my online web account to do it.  The problem was if you had the web app before, the setup process requires you to upgrade your online profile from 2013 to 2014.  Once Quicken decided it couldn't attach to the old online profile to upgrade, it would get stuck somewhere in the update process and I couldn't use the program.  I had to diddle around finding a way to circumvent the online upgrade process so I could use normal Quicken again, meaning there were a few tense days where I couldn't use Quicken at all.  Total pisser...but now that I think I've gotten everything upgraded, it really is a wonderful program.	2014-01-12

With this key card, you simply download the Microsoft Office Suite, which contains the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Whether or not to upgrade to this latest version of the Office Suite if you own earlier versions will be a matter of personal need. I own multiple computers with various versions of the office suite, and use the office suite at work as well. Because of the compatibility among the versions, I don't worry too much about the upgrading to the latest and greatest versions of the suite.<br /><br />We used this card to install the Microsoft Office Suite on our laptop that our son is taking to college. The software license is single PC, so for that reason it made sense to tie it to the college laptop. (I also use and love One Note at work, and think its organizational utility would be great for college.)<br /><br />If you want to have a license for more than one computer, I believe some of the other options tha Microsoft offers would be more economical than this single PC license, but for a single license, this solution for all 4 apps is a fair deal.	2013-09-28

V12 offers a lot of new editing pieces to the mix but I rarely use them.  Most of my videos get uploaded to Facebook, Youtube or are burned to blu-ray discs for personal use.  Or...I will just store them on my computer and stream to my TV's through various devices like my PS3.<br /><br />I recently got a new camcorder to replace my older mini-dv camera so importing videos into v12 is much easier than what I used to do.  I have edited about 8 various movie clips with this software with each clip ranging from 2 minutes to 20 minutes and it works very much like V11 did but the rendering time has been cut down quite a bit.  I installed this version in a separate folder so my v11 is still on my PC.  I did this because I had issues in the past when initially upgrading to a new version (all issues fixed from updates by Cyberlink).<br /><br />I ran a test to see how long each program would take to render a video for youtube (since this always seems to take forever).  Based on a 5 minute clip, V11 took just under 12 minutes and v12 took under 10 minutes.  Not a huge savings byut still about 17% faster.  Of course, mulitple factors can cause differnces such as other PC usage.  I didn't use my PC during rendering but I have so much stuff running on it that any one of them could cause delays.<br /><br />If you have V11, and you are not a hardcore editor, then there is absolutely no need to upgrade.  In fact, V10 is probably fine as well but V12 does render faster.  If you have a slower computer, it might not be able to handle the faster rendering anyway.<br /><br />For the record, I have an 2.6ghz I7 (Ivy Bridge I think) with 16gb of RAM, 256 SSD and 3TB backup drive and a 4gb Geforce graphics card.  No slouch but not top of the line either.	2014-01-02

I quickly got over that and captured a different way. Then I came to a limited amount of transitions to use. I have been used to using Adobe Premiere CS3 and maybe that's why I feel so limited on this software. On top of that, the work space is small. I would have gotten over many other small things until my computer crashed and rebooted itself. I know I have plenty of space and RAM .

I didn't like windows 8.  Came preloaded on a Dell Laptop and after a week reformatted and loaded windows 7.  I stayed away from anything windows 8.  I got a windows tablet a few months ago preloaded with 8.1.  I took the suggestion and downloaded classic shell.  Now the desktop looks and feels like Windows 7.  As far as the underlying OS goes, win 8.1 works fine.  No issues, I just didn't like the interface but the OS works as is should.  Everything I want to do I am able to.  It is even pretty fast on a tablet with an atom processor.  Like many I am waiting for Windows 10 to come out.  I beta tested Win 10 and am really looking forward to its release.  It is what windows 8 should have been although I wish they would bring back aero.  WIn 10 is still the blocky, almost pastel colored looking desktop like win 8 but has a traditional start button that brings up the start menu where you can access everything you could on windows 7 and other previous versions.

I forgot the name of a company). Rotate View Tool (finally copied from Painter's original). Exceptional Dodge and Burn Tools improvements - that's what we expected for a long time! Great addition to Adjustment Layers is Vibrance. New Mask Palette is really good, etc.    Moderate Thoughts:  Still unsure about User Interface changes - do we need rearrange furniture when we have pales of garbage in the middle of the dining room? As a graphic designer I don't really understand necessity of the Analysis Menu and its contents. 3D Tools still needs a lot of improvements - still weak and rather for wasting of the time.    Cons:  During last versions Photoshop UI changed dramatically, but for years Adobe ignores upgrades of what suppose to be powerful Photoshop weapon - Filters. Since version 3.0 Filter Menu haven't changed a bit. Still the same useless Blur, Blur More, Sharp, Sharp More. Still the same from grandmother's chest Distort Filters - Pinch, Polar Coordinates, Shear, Spherize, Twirl, Zig-Zag and many more.

Generally, I have been satisfied with the programs, and, have purchased several versions to keep up to date. I purchased the latest version (Pinnacle 16) and the installation went smoothly. On using the product I found the user interface had changed and not for the better. It is much more difficult to use. The program crashes frequently. It does not handle several clips well. I have found it impossible to get an product support. I would no longer recommend Pinnacle as a video editing tool. In my opinion the program has gotten worse rather than better with the latest version.	2013-04-27

I have a makeup and skin care channel on YouTube, and I have edited every video I've made for my channel on an older version of this software (Corel VideoStudio Pro X4). Basic video editing (importing video, deleting clips,  etc.) was very easy to learn. Some of the other stuff took a bit of time (I tend to prefer hands-on learning vs. depending on the user manual for everything). I had been using Windows Moviemaker before that so I knew that VSPro X4 had a button/function for what I needed--it was just a matter of finding it and learning a new way of using it (if it was different from WMM).<br /><br />Now I have Corel VS Pro X7 and am super excited about the new content and functionality it offers over V4, especially faster rendering, since my makeup videos are often between 10 and15 minutes long. They've got a new template feature called FastFlick that will I think be GREAT for when I'm in a hurry to get a video up on my channel. It should also be a great way for beginners to Corel VS Pro to get up and running fast!<br /><br />Once I have more experience with the new version, I plan to add a video portion to this review so I can demonstrate more about how it works and show some of the differences between my older version and this version!	2014-05-15

Form validations are crude at best	I have used frontpage for many years even after it was unsupported and still use it on some web sites.  When the next job came in I decided to dust off web easy 8 and have at it.  The templates included are nice, but do not modify them away from what they've provided or the site will not display correctly.  I spent hours monkeying with sites that would display locally just fine and then when uploaded not display correctly at all.  There is no real support like a chat session and their web site based help is lacking leaving a lot of fields and lower level detail absent.  When I created a form, that seemed to be pretty nice, send the data off, then get another page saying thanks for the info.  Please note that the forms are of a fixed set and type of fields and its very hard to change the field types or names and if you delete an un needed field, more problems than you want to even think about.  And, if you want any validation on the fields you will have to cut and paste text and jump through hoops to get the validation linked to an object style, and their tutorials don't give you enough info other than 'do this here' to explain why you have to do some of the necessary steps.  This can lead to all sorts of problems down the road.  The straw that broke my back with the product was when I modified to remove a little triangle off a navigation bar and that threw the whole page off into a complete mess.  That was after hours of trying to get the navigation to work.  I also had problems with Easy 8, so bought the upgrade to 10, and while that made the product a bit better, all the problems I just noted, were with Web Easy 10.  It makes no sense to me why a minor mod would throw the whole page off.  But, neither here nor there, frontpage 2003 works better.  So I then dusted off my Serif X2 which I had not spent a lot of time with and imported the web sleazy site.  It only took 2 hours to recover the design and move on.  X2 has much better form management and while you mightnot get the form to look exactly like what you want, there is decent field validation that quashes any look and feel issues.  Find a different product.  Btw, been doing web pages off and on for over 10 years....	2014-05-14

Nero is a core burning tool. This means that several backup packages out there will actually find Nero on install and use it for burning. One example is DVDshrink that runs Nero in the background while backing up DVD movies on DVD-R. I/O errors with these programs, including DVD Decrypter, are usually the result of a configuration problem with Nero. One example is updating your firmware. Sometimes this requires you to reinstall Nero. This problem however is the only bug I have found with Nero. Just on the side - I highly recommend a Plextor external DVD burner for reliability and Imation, Memorex, Verbatim as relatively cheap good second class media (80% or higher burn success rate). DVD is still in its early days of development and some media is garbage so don't blame Nero or the Plextor if you make coasters (half burned DVD-R Discs that are useless to you) with this software. I also recommend a healthy supply of at least 3 DVD-RW Discs for TESTING your burning so that you NEVER make a coaster and waste money. Okay, now back to Nero.<br /><br />Nero Burning Rom is the real tool in the bundle. It is the most configurable burning tool in the package while Nero Express is for those who do not know a thing about burning and works like a Wizard. A word of advice is to stick with the Rom and learn it without using the Wizard. You can choose from burning 12 CD formats and 6 DVD formats, including several variations of each format. There is not a Disc format you can not Burn with this program. The Plextor burners have great hardware based error correction systems and in conjunction with the Nero software make a perfect burn almost every time. Nero also happens to be extremely fast, if not the fastest out there, however fast is also in terms of how fast your burner is, but the software package requires little to no processing before a 8GB DVD is being pulled onto your HD. You can create ISOs with Nero and even use Nero to open up ISOs so you can read the content (However Daemon Tools does that better). There is an amazing amount of free software out there that uses this burner as their base and rightly so. It is the best burning software out there at this time of writing.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- If you can learn tutorials for all types of backups then this and a DVD burner will change your life if you play games and watch movies.<br /><br />- Solid performance. With good hardware and media almost flawless burns every time.<br /><br />- Nice configuration. Can even backup your PS2 Games.<br /><br />- All burning formats.<br /><br />- About 70mb in size.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Let's face it. DVD burning and backup does have a bit of a learning curve. Read plenty of tutorials that use Nero to do specific backups.<br /><br />- Corrupts if hardware and other software is updated. Needs to be reinstalled again.<br /><br />- You really need a top of the range machine to backup a DVD in less than 2 hours.d onto your HD.

I had a little bit of troubles getting my email accounts linked to it.  First my hotmail account made me download an extra program then I had to tweak a few of my settings on my gmail account in order to get them syncing smoothly.  It wasn't too difficult though, I just looked it up on [...] and there were good instructions. I spent about 30 minutes getting them set up.<br /><br />If you use more than one or two email accounts that you check regularly this is the type of program you will want to look into buying.  I was surprised by the freedom of being able to arrange my emails.  I was actually able to go through and cleanup my inbox and delete tons of old unneeded emails at such a quick rate. There are many different options that allow you organize your emails efficiently.  It's quick too.<br /><br />If I were to say what this program does for me it is a combination of an email organizer and a scheduler. The program has an excellent calendar system.  At first I was a little confused by all of the different options and things but I bought a book and learned how to use them.  I have to say my schedule has never been so organized before.  Not only that but it's color coordinated. It looks super nice and there are many options on how to view it.  One of the views that I believe is new is Schedule view, which will transform your calendar into a scheduler in less than a second.  I am impressed with this software.<br /><br />I like it and I definitely think it was worth the money.	2010-08-13

My star rating is only meant to reflect this product, not anything else, I just wanted to include other things in the review in case they could help anyone else decide whether to purchase or not.<br /><br />My background with Version 10:<br />I wanted so badly to love this product and the company. All of the reviews I've read rave about their customer service, and the product. However, I've been let down time and time again. I originally purchased version 10 of this product in Jan 2012 after doing a lot of research ways to recipe programs. I ultimately decided on Cook'n due to the its feature list and promise of cloud syncing with phone apps, advertised to be release that spring. Well, they weren't released that spring. I actually just finally downloaded the iphone app a few days ago (about a year and a half later). In their defense, they did post something explaining the delay at one point or another, however the computer program itself was sooooo slow, buggy, and cumbersome that I stopped using it before the cloud or the apps were released. But the program had a solid concept, and I thought that if they could work the bugs out it would be amazing, so when I got the email about version 11 and saw the new features and updates I thought I'd give them one more shot and upgrade.<br /><br />Enter version 11...<br />Firstly, a lot of people who pre-ordered didn't get their download link until very late on \\"release\\" day, myself included. Mine didn't arrive until hours after I'd gone to bed on the 18th (release date). Apparently there was some glitch with their email provider they were unaware of that caused the delay, however there's no excuse, imo, for not at least letting us know what was going on (If nothing else, they have a facebook page, they couldn't take 30 secondsto type up a status letting us know there was an issue and they were working on it? Really? Far from the stellar customer service I'd heard of...) And then I got the program.<br /><br />The new features I was most excited about were the following:<br />- Automatic Pinterest Capture<br />- Recipe imports from scans/pictures<br />- Recipe captures from blog pages (or other unformatted online sources)<br />- Cloud syncing with iphone app<br />- Speed Improvements (seriously needed.)<br /><br />So to break it down... (And as a disclaimer, of course, I realize that all automatic features are going to have issues now and again, but these are major/repeated issues)<br />The pinterest capture worked... somewhat. It automatically created a new cookbook with a chapter called \\"Recipes\\" and put all the recipes on the board i selected in it. Each recipe has a title (sometimes ended up being the site url instead of the title, but ok), and a picture. NONE of them had ingredients, 5 recipes out of 72 imported had anything even remotely relevant in the directions box. Ugh.<br /><br />Recipe imports from scans/pictures: Nope. I've tried both scans and pictures, using only recipes that are laid out normally with clear, normal fonts and no pictures or colors or anything weird. The pictures and scans were all clear and in focus, easily readable. However, I keep getting results like this: (A sample of the text it gives from a Beef Bourguignon  recipe, copied and pasted directly from Cook'n)<br /><br />leclltlltllltltl  (This line should say Beef Bourguignon....)<br />Serves 6<br />Ingredients:<br />1 1/2 pounds baby carrots ¢_ .<br />11/2 pounds parloniom ` _ _ ?g)<br />Zpoundsleanbeefstanmeatmubed '- »<br />Saltandpeppmmtaste `ta / faij\\"<br />ltablespoonollveoll --<br />6qreenonlons,chopped<br />3dovts¢r||c,prssed<br />1cupredw|ne(oruseredgrape)uloewIthasplashofvlnegar)<br /><br />You get the picture.<br /><br />Import from blog pages: When you can get the \\"snip-it\\" tool to pop up, it works awesomely. However it almost never pops up for me and I can't find a way to manually enter \\"snip-it\\" mode. I plan to contact support and ask about this and if they give me an answer I'll revise. But for now... when I try to capture a blog recipe it captures the title, maybe it puts some random text from the page in the directions (and if I'm really lucky, it'll actually catch the directions), but never any ingredients. I've only gotten the snip-it tool to pop up once, and it was on a page I'd already tried 4 times out of frustration, so it seems to just be random.<br /><br />Cloud sync: Love it. It's a bit slow though. The initial sync took me about 4 hours total (2 to get from my computer to the cloud, and 2 from the cloud to my phone app), which was expected. Since then, each has taken about 10 minutes or so in cook'n 11, and my phone app I just have to close and reopen for it to load.<br /><br />Speed improvements: They've definitely made some. It still requires a progress bar to open/close the program, but it opens and closes much faster than it did... there were some days that it would take 10+ minutes in version 10. And while my outdated computer could have contributed to this, it wasn't something I'd ever experienced with any other program on it. Now, it averages 10-20 seconds to open or close, 1-2 minutes if it's doing a backup, or opening after a backup.<br /><br />The live feed - one of the other new features, is actually pretty cool. I quite like it. It would be better if I could reliably auto-import recipes from it though....<br /><br />So In a nutshell:<br />If you're wiling to manually put in almost all your recipes, this is a solid program -a bit slow, feels a bit outdated still, but the organizational ability is great, having a cloud backup is great, being able to carry around all my recipes on my phone is wonderful. I tag all my recipes with categories that make meal planning a snap - especially with the shopping list function (which syncs well to my phone in a checklist format that I can cross off). The automatic features have MAJOR bugs, don't buy just for those, at least right now.  However, I simply don't trust the company, and in my opinion this program was no where near ready to be released. I'd expect this kind of functioning out of a beta test, at best... maybe even an alpha, not an $80 program.  I will say that based on my experience with version 10 they will release updates regularly to fix some of the bugs and make improvements, probably even new features. And the customer service has always responded to every email I've ever sent, though it wasn't always a helpful response. I suspect at some point they'll even comment on this review and instruct me to contact support, so I'll say now that I already plan to and will update this accordingly, but it won't change my initial thoughts... that the company repeatedly hasn't kept to their advertised deadlines, and repeatedly releases products before they're ready.	2013-11-22

As I started installing the McAfee software, the software stopped loading and informed me that both Norton Antivirus and Norton Systemworks had to be uninstalled prior to installing McAfee software.  This was very annoying since (1) I had to do the Norton unistall myself, (2) Norton Systemworks has the option to uninstall the antivirus portion while keeping the system utilities, but McAfee wouldn't load until Norton was completely uninstalled, and (3) there was no way to override or get around the McAfee program requirements.      Now that McAfee is installed, I like it, but the installation was a pain.	2008-09-10

Its a really great program for editing movies. When I got a new laptop after my old one took a poop, I ordered this program for on it. The program arrived early, and I was extremely excited about putting it on my new computer. However, I received the program back in March, and here it is almost June and I still cannot get it to download to my computer. I even had my boyfriend who is a computer tech to look at it, and he couldn't get it to work either. Highly disappointed since I paid money for a program and I cant use. Would give the movie maker a five star if only it would install.	2014-05-21

If you get a network connection to the Internet without having to reboot right off the bat, you will loose it if your computer sleeps on you.  This is more than maddening especially if you possess a 2 meg a second d/l internet connection and every other item you have that uses your router has no problem.  Not just me either.  Changing Win 8 to power save NIC (on Asus P6T) didn't help. No its not virus-checking software or firewalls and if someone quotes Microsoft's \\"tech babel\\" ignore it.  It must be the new company line for this issue.  Good luck finding a Microsoft person to complain to as well.<br /><br />The rest of learning the ways to manipulate Win 8 I could learn to live with.  Quirks are some applications (eg IE Explorer) are 32-bit in one place and 64 bit in another which makes no sense at all.<br /><br />Mail on the splash page is a piece of crap.  I would rather just have it open the regular Outlook mail interface rather than the inflexible apps MS prefers.<br /><br />I was considering buying a Surface Pro but I have just talked myself out of buying one by writing this.<br /><br />My computer experience?  Started with a TI-99/4A (48k memory) and basically have supported MS and its products for over two decades.  I've loaded Windows into high memory, tweaked Autoexec.bat files and config.sys files to play games with sound, installed mother boards, upgraded CPUs/video cards/memory/power supplies blah blah blah but I believe I've reached the end of the road here with MS.	2013-03-21

Most the negative reviews of this product are from people who have used previous versions of Quicken, and has issues with the upgrade from the old version.  I've never used Quicken, so I can't comment on those types of issues, but I can comment on this version in itself.  The software is great.  The thing that shocked me the most was the ability of the software to connect to all of my banks, credit card companies, etc, and pull information into one screen.  I do business with some fairly small banks, so I'm not sure how they manage to pull this off, but its super nice.  While I prefer to charge everything rather than pay cash, sometimes it does make it easy to lose track of how much money you are spending on eating out, or a particular category.  Quicken shows you graphs of the categories you are spending your money, which can be a real wake-up call.<br /><br />This software probably isn't for everybody.  If you're pretty good at budgeting your money, then you will probably have a hard time justifying spending $40 on this product.  For other people, it will end up saving them way more than $40.  While I am probably in the first category, the review is on the software itself, and Intuit has done a great job with the software.  The user interface is well designed, and easy to use, and all of the included features are very helpful.  Whether or not the product is worth the price is a decision you'll have to make yourself, but rest assured that the software works great if you do decide to buy it.	2012-12-02

There are two important reasons for EVERYONE to be concern and informed about these issues.  The first is your computer is under constant attack by people who wish to break in and steal your data or ruin your lives by harming your data or hardware.  Computer hackers are constantly trying to break into computers!  So if you have unprotected data on your computer, it is subject to viruses and hackers.  Take that to the next level and put your data on another server or servers, and you further expose your data and your life and risk data compromise.  Just like what happened to Target Stores, the fact is your data and software is simply safer in your own home or office.  The second concern I have is the economy.  Cloud based software compels you to upgrade each year for a monthly or annual fee.  What happens is the economy completely sucks, the political leadership is forcing socialism on us that is wrecking the economy and you simply cannot afford to upgrade.  If you have cloud based software, you are screwed.  If you own your software and you have it installed on YOUR COMPUTER as was the practice for the past 25+ years, then you can choose to upgrade of you can choose not to upgrade.  But your choices and freedoms are being taken from you and cloud based software, in my opinion, contributes to the soft tyranny being imposed on us all.  May we all stand up against it and not buy cloud based software...only legacy software.  God Bless, Joe	2014-01-01

Background:    I have two Intel Macs with aluminum and glass cases (one a non-unibody 24-inch iMac, another a unibody 13.3-inch MacBook Pro. They both have Core 2 Duo processors and so would not run Mac OS X 10.7 to a decent level of capability. Then I heard how Apple was going to deprecate the MobileMe that I willingly paid $180 for so it could stay around for 2 years. Now Apple is going to throw not just that pittance but the money I spent on three Intel Macs and a Time Capsule that did what I wanted to (over $3000!) out the window. So, I struck back, and keep Snow Leopard configured in a pleasing manner (I am smart about what I do on the Internet and like the level of functionality I currently have) and decided to supplement my Snow Leopard with Windows 7. What version of Windows 7 deserves to go on an Intel Mac? For me, the answer was simple: The same version as what I have in Snow Leopard-not a single missing feature but not installed with objectionable updates (which I don't want the Mac App Store and I don't want a Windows App Store either). So I run Windows 7 Ultimate on my 2 Intel Macs with the Internet Explorer 9 and Windows 7 SP1 hidden, and they will stay so as long as absolutely possible.    With that said, here are my opinions of the various features:    1. The new taskbar. It kicks butt. I had to download the Windows 7 RC over a 1.5Mbit DSL connection just to experience the new taskbar early, and when I got opportunities, I bought Windows 7 that so fat has been fully legal to avoid hassles. And yes, I know Windows 7 has Windows Genuine Advantage, but if that's going to be an issue I expect that Microsoft will inform me of what to do about it (the one problem I had was successfully dealt with and they answered another question most kindly. My experience has been top notch, probably because God gives me better luck. (I actually pray about things like this and so far God has not failed me).    2. HomeGroup. When all three Windows 7 computers are on and awake, HomeGroup works perfectly for me. I am most pleased with its performance.    3. Windows XP Mode. All three computers have an edition of Windows 7 that allows it, although one doesn't support virtualization and the unassisted virtualization updater refuses to believe it's needed. I use it for Microsoft Sam, and will not be afraid to load applications into Windows XP Mode should I need them. The 13.3-inch Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro has more audio garbling than the iMac does (the iMac has almost none.)    3. BitLocker Drive Encryption. I found one nice fellow who posted directions on a way to make BitLocker work without a TPM 1.2 or better chip, and it allows me to have access to every feature I paid for. I am most pleased with Windows 7 in that regard.    4. Language Packs. It helps having a laptop and desktop that if I need to can switch languages so I can help people who may need it. I have not needed it so far.    5. The Geek Factor: I must say, Windows 7 Ultimate gives me great pride that I can have access to not just the basic set of features in Home Premium, but that if someone has a problem with Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate, I can help them.    The features that are also in Windows 7 Professional (which I have on an old Intel Cantrino Santa Rosa Mobile Technology former Vista laptop, that was bought well before the offer to get a free Windows 7 upgrade, but that I used my student $30 offer for-I paid more to get extended download time and a DVD backup; plus I got the 32-bit version, which didn't have the installation nightmare of the 64-bit version)are also so good to have in the toolbox of available Windows 7 features. I love, out of the Windows 7 Professional level features, Network Aware Printing. I go to my aunt and uncle's ginormous house every now and then, and my Windows 7 Professional laptop (and to be fair, my Windows 7 Ultimate MacBook Pro now too) can simply go from the color and black and white laser printers here to my aunt anduncle's OfficeJer J4580 and back again. Windows 7 Hoem Premium is too little for my dual-cre Windows 7 computers, although I will put it on my eMachine-a W3622 with a single core Celeron-420 at 1.6GHz and Intel GMA 950 barely Aero-capable graphics.    Plus, I can have people who are having Windows 7 issues send to me for Remote Assistance and pull their computer up on my iMac, which has a big enough screen to help most people, especially if they have laptops. And I can, if the problem is not fixable under Remote Assistance, take my MacBook Pro and have a point of comparison on-site with me.    Especially since I got Windows 7 from good to great discounts (through eBay for Windows 7 Ultimate) and Microsoft's student offer (for Windoes 7 Professional) I feel like I got everything I needed for plenty fair enough prices.    I love the way 3 or more Windows 7 computers work with each other. I truly do love it. I guess I better end this review before I take an eternity.    Plus, I saw a commercial on TV that ran a fair amount last year showiing a computer at one person's home being accessed by a laptop that someone let them borrow. The remote computer was displaying an Aero desktop on the laptop. Windows Vista (even Ultimate, to the best of my knowledge) couldn't do this. So I investigated, and after months of not knowing, I found out that Windows 7 Ultimate, with the experience section maxed, could do it but Professional couldn't. If you love the Aero eye candy and especially love Windows 7's improvements to it from Vista, that, every bit as much as BitLocker and BitLocker To Go, or the language packs provided free, make Windows 7 Ultimate worth the money over even Professional, provided your hardware can give you something at least approaching an optimal experience. In other words, a Bloomfield, Lynnfield, Clarksdale, or Arrandale or their Sandy Bridge successors (for those who like them) CPUs, or a Core 2 Duo, Quad, or Extreme with dedicated or NVIDIA integrated graphics will be just about perfect for Windows 7 Ultimate, and if it can have 5GHz 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR or better along with Gigabit Ethernet and maybe a TPM 1.2 or better chip as well, then that's all the better.    But anyway, especially with worthy hardware, Windows 7 Ultimate is worth the expense in this user's eye, because he has hardware that can come remarkably close to being perfect for Windows 7 Ultimate.    Go Microsoft for Windows 7, you made excellent choices in all but 2 areas of the Windows 7 experience. Windows 8 however is as tough a sale as Vista was (but fora different reason), because I don't want my desktop OS (even on a netbook) to be the same as my mobile OS, and Lion faces similar roadblocks from Snow Leopard.    Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:    I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.    I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.    I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.    Update 11-21-2013:    I since set it up with a third computer in a Dell OptiPlex 745 so I could experience what it's like on \\"a real PC\\", where it dual boots with XP Professional from Dell OEM installer media. Asidefrom requiring a custom sound driver for the sound card to support the internal speaker that it has (spent all the money on Windows 7, so now I can't afford speakers that work), it worked perfectly out of the box.    Unfortunately, after Windows 8 hit general availability, Windows 8 gets Media Center that supports Internet TV while that feature was removed from Windows 7 at Microsoft's behest to push 8. After finding Windows 8 doesn't like to dual-boot with Windows 7 on hardware that supports UEFI (I have one of the rare Windows 7 PCs to support UEFI bought a month before Windows 8 General Availability) I'm now looking at having to sit there and remove my Windows 7 hard disk to install 8 and then manually put the Windows 7 hard disk back in and pray Windows 8 hasn't overwritten my default BIOS settings that are compatible.    I want Media Center to work on Windows 7, since this is a $320 fully legal piece of software (when used on computers it was officially activated with.) On Windows 7 Home Premium, I really don't care, but on Windows 7 Ultimate, I want Media Center and would gladly give up on Internet Explorer 11 and support of consumer versions to 2020.    Windows 9 had better be better than 8 and as good as 7, if not, I'll buy a used MacBook or Pro with Lion to replace the MacBook Pro whose fan overstressed so bad that I had to trade it at a loss (AppleCare wouldn't support it if it wasn't fully up-to-date, and I didn't want to update to Lion that soon given the problem-prone NVIDIA graphics my older model MacBook Pro had.)    The 745, and a PC laptop I bought an upgrade copy of Windows 7 Ultimate for that originally ran Home Premium Vista, both work so well but I insist on Media Center getting full support, because with the bad things I've heard on Windows 8 (and even suprisingly bad things for Windows 8.1), I want to use Windows 7 Ultimate long after it's Internet browsing ability (except to activate) is gone.    That's just a rant from someone far too satisfied with Windows 7 for their own good, or so the Windows 8 fanboys would say. I consider myself a Windows 8 hater, because Microsoft didn't make the right moves as regards Windows 8.    End Update 11-21-2013    Update 2-3-2014:    Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.    Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.    For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.    End Update 2-3-2014    Update 2-27-2014:    I was busy trying to do research to determine whether I should run Windows 8 on a late production Windows 7 PC or whether it would be a more productive use of the second hard drive in this PC to backup the system configuration and image of this copy of Windows 7 as well as my copy of Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade that had SP1 included. Well, I sat there and started the backup to this other PC, which had received a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack Upgrade and Office 2003 Student and Teacher Edition, and it was so easy. I knew my money spent on high-end copies of Windows 7 rather than buying a Windows Home Server which that OS later was discontinued, was oh so worth it. A similar update will be on Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade.    End Update 2-27-2014    Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):    When that iMac that had the full install copy bit the bullet (the SuperDrive ruined the Boot Camp installer, it's too old to use a thumb drive to load Boot Camp drivers let alone Windows 7) I had to find some other way to use Windows 7 Ultimate. Thankfully, by setting aside a spare CD-key of Windows 7 Home Premium (that and the PC it went on was originally designed to allow the iMac to backup before the iMac's unreliability in Windows 7 Ultimate torpedoed that option), specifically an RTM product install rather than SP1), I was able to finally transfer Windows 7 Ultimate from the iMac to the formerly spare PC. Now I've got Windows 7 Ultimate up and running with Office 2007 and don't miss a single thing.    Why did I do this? Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to \\"replace\\" 7:    I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!    I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?    I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!    I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.    End Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update)	2011-06-09

After spending 5 hours trying various ways g to install it (it crashes my machine on boot up - I have a computer science degree and I patched, copied and pleaded with this thing) I anxiously awaited the help lines to open up - (they run only on Pacific time). I got into one of the chat lines for help and was 49th in the queue and after an hour or so gave up. It won't install for me and I was unable to get support. 12 hours attempting to install this - I could have done a budget on paper in half that time.

Every time I started I had to go through this routine. NORMALLY since I had just installed the software I'd do a clean install and be happily on my way. However, with the new copy protection scheme they are using (and IMPOSSIBLE hold times) I was too nervous to try it, because it sounded like you'd quickly be forced into purchasing 2,3,4 or even five copies if you had to reinstall. <br />Also, whenever something doesn't work on my system I am always worried now that the copy protection is causing it. I can't wait till I can STRIP Turbotax off my computer and be back to a clean and safe system. Next year I'll be getting taxcut, and hopefully it won't be so invasive.	2003-02-02

This kindly informs me that I only rate a 5.8 out of 10 on my &quot;security index&quot; (whatever that is).  All I have to do to score a 10 is buy all their other products.<br />McAfee should be ashamed of themselves for the blatant advertising of their other products embedded into the application.  The tray icon with quick access to the McAfee Store is particularly offensive.<br />In terms of feature set, this version adds no apparent value over the previous version.  In fact, some features seem to be missing (cannot seem to fine-tune the scan settings), or maybe are just so well-hidden as to appear missing.  <br />The Updater application no longer runs in the background, requiring manual checks for updates (note that McAfee claims it runs in the background, but it does not actually do so--the &quot;Install Automatically&quot; option has yet to download a DAT file).  Strangely, the Updater runs in a browser popup requiring one to remember to turn off popup blockers in order to make it work.<br />The &quot;improved&quot; scanning engine now detects &quot;potentially unwanted&quot; applications.  If you happen to have something that makes the cut, you will be reminded on every scan--if there is a way to exclude a file, it is exceptionally well hidden.<br />In short, if you do not currently own a virus scanner, then this one will do the job.  If you already have one, do not bother &quot;upgrading&quot; to this one.	2003-12-12

Before You Know It uses the flashcard method of teaching vocabulary four ways. Words and phrases are divided into lists by category. User selects a list then goes to the activity of choice to learn the contents of that list. There are a few more activities available in the Deluxe version that the free trial version doesn't have, but both versions use virtual flashcards the following way:  <br /> <br />Step 1 - Look at the foreign word and take a guess (out loud or in your head - it doesn't matter because the software trusts you to tell it if you answered correctly). The program will also say the word so you know the proper pronunciation.  <br /> <br />Step 2 - Look at the foreign word and type in it in English in the space provided. Here you don't get to cheat, because it can tell if your correct or not. The ones you need work on will repeat more often.  <br /> <br />Step 3 - Look at the English word and guess the foreign one. Again, it will trust you to be honest.  <br /> <br />Step 4 - Look at the English word and type in the foreign one. This has been the most helpful of all the steps for me, because not only do I have to know the word by now, I have to know how to spell it correctly and include any necessary accent marks.  <br /> <br />All of the above you can get with the basic version of Before You Know It that is available to download for free via the internet. Why not try it out before you purchase the deluxe version? <br /> <br />With the deluxe version, you get more four more activities which include multiple choice, pronunciation practice where you can record your voice and compare your pronunciation with a native speaker (warning: software does NOT include a microphone), and dictation (which is just a repeat of step 4 of the flashcard portion).  <br /> <br />My favorite thing about this software, though, and what made me go ahead and spend the money for the deluxe version, is the user's ability to customize the program in several different ways:  <br />-User can add a word to any list. You just look up more words you want to know online or in a dictionary and add it to the appropriate category.  <br />- User can delete any word from any list.  <br />- User can copy any word from one list to another.  <br />- User can edit any word in any list. This is handy when studying Spanish because you might want to change the translation from European to Latin American.  <br />- User can create entire lists and categories of their own, add their own pictures and record their own voices to demonstrate the pronunciation of each word. You can create lists for anything you want to learn - not just languages.  <br />- User can download additional, free lists from the Before You Know It website, including state capitals, periodic table of elements (chemistry), multiplication tables, and more. And you can sign up for the free \\"list of the week.\\" Each week, a new list will be sent to you via email.  <br /> <br />This software will help you master your foreign vocabulary and learn helpful phrases, but it does not teach the rules of grammar for these languages. You won't learn conjugation unless you look up the form of each word yourself and add it to their lists or create your own lists.  <br /> <br />In other words, the customizing possibilities for this are almost endless if you're willing and able to invest the time to do it. But what it comes with already installed is meant to simply increase your foreign vocabulary and, used alone, will not make anyone a fluent speaker.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2006-03-07

It gives you some good information as to when to plant, etc and in what areas things go well in.  I don't personally use that.  I don't have time, but if you can get into that, it'd be worth it for you.

I'd agree with a lot of what was said in the other review, the good and the bad.   <br /> <br />But the key factor in .Mac which is the clincher is Syncing.  The ability to have multiple calendars, addressbooks,bookmarks and email synced across distributed computers and available online to you on any computer is reason enough for a lot of people to subscribe.  <br /> <br />I think it should be 50 bucks myself :0)  but Amazon is the place to buy...it's usually cheaper here than in an Apple Store and if you can get free delivery and no taxes you are better off.	2005-11-19

A very powerful chess engine with a very interesting feature called \\"Let's Check\\" that lets you see and possibly contribute to online analysis. Unfortunately the user interface is a disaster, and NOT intuitive. The help functions are primitive - be prepared to spend hours searching the Internet for help and watching online tutorials.

WillMaker Plus 2004 is an update to Quicken Lawyer 2003.  You still get a bunch of general-use legal forms (such as complaint letters, in case, say, you don't like the software!), but what the program really shines is still in estate planning.  Through a Q&amp;A process, you can write your own will.  I recommend you make a list of your major assets before starting the will-making session, because that'll make things a total breeze.  The program includes clear instructions to guide you through the process.  You can also create other estate planning forms for things like living trusts, power of attorney, etc.  I have always felt the price for the program was a bit high, and still think so, but if you want a comprehensive suite of will-making tools, this is simply the best.	2003-08-12

The last one I purchased (5-20-2014) was sold by ZBA-Sales. While it was an OEM copy with a sticker, it's an OA version of the OEM software which is meant for large OEM's who use the BIOS activation method as opposed to the generic OEM software which is what Amazon usually ships.<br /><br />This means the product will not activate automatically - you have to use the phone activation method.  I am a Microsoft Partner and contacted my rep and he verified that the software is legit but as I stated above, it's intended for OEM's using the BIOS activation method.<br /><br />Just a heads up - see who the seller is when looking at the product and realize that you may get an OA copy which will require manual activation.<br /><br />Edit: That all said, when I went to put the sticker on the new PC, I found that it wasn't removable from the plastic sleeve the media came in.

It seems some things were over written or deleted in the installation process. I imagine it's repairable with setting changes, maybe reinstalling some things, but I have yet to figure out what they are, and I certainly didn't expect to have to do that sort of thing! Specifically, my settings say I have no audio device, although my system sounds work and my settings ALSO say my internal audio device is working properly. Needless to say I have no sound when I try to play a video.  Also, I can no longer access the internet ... although it says my internet connection is \\"excellent\\". Initially I could for brief periods, but I would get DNS error messages and lose access. Now I can't access the internet at all (while it still says internet connection is \\"excellent\\".)

The thing about NM Collector is it works and ends up being the go to program. You can save reports as PDF with pictures or lists without pictures. Then print them out if wanted.<br />I took off one star because the program is  little slow and the interface isn't as easy to learn as one might think it should be. I will say now with version three out there have been improvements. Still it would be nice if it was a little more intuitive and followed the same type of interface other programs use. I might say it's sort of like looking back at the way a dos program looked. But as I said it works where some others I have don't do as promised.<br />NM Collector is written in Java so it will work on most computers and it can be saved to and run from a thumb drive.<br />I've owned the program for many years and from time to time see something new bright and shiny so I buy it, then I'm right back to using NM Collector to print out my reports when the new program doesn't do as advertised.	2014-04-01

BeadCreator 6 Pro is one of the best softwares I've purchased in a long, long time.  I am an avid beader.  I do loom work, bead weaving and many other techniques with beads.  For the loom and bead weaving, this is the product I would highly recommend to other beaders.  What I like about it is that I can design my own image, upload it to the BeadCreator software, and it automatically converts it to a pattern of my choice - whether it's loom, brick stitch, peyote, so forth.  This automated conversion has allowed me to do countless projects without taking the time to manually manipulate a pattern.  Plus, creating your own images is the best!  Or, you can use countless images provided through BeadCreator software.  In addition, it gives you a full palette of colors in Delicas with the number of beads per color you'll need to make the pattern.  No guessing!  I've used the BeadCreator software from it's inception and love each and every version of it.	2011-09-30

Kenneth Branagh does an excellent job reading the text (in English, a French version is not included) as well as the other narrators. The voice of the Little Prince is one to cherish. The cd-rom includes a reading of the story along with the text and some animation. The text is not always shown for those of you who want to use this to teach your child to read, but where the text is not shown, animation or a picture helps the reader understand. Also included are activities such as taking care of Asteroid B-612 and taming the fox. When you successfully tame the fox, which takes some patience, you are rewarded with a personal diary and printable stationary. The music which accompanies the reading is high quality. I am so impressed with the quality or this cd-rom that I plan to buy more titles published by Tivola.	2001-07-03

Seems like a simple enough product, however,  MacFreelance fails to deliver on any of its promises.     After installing the software and setting up a few test jobs, I thought I had the hang of it. I then added a handful of real jobs, closed the program and went about other business. Later, upon reopening the program, I realized that all of the information I had spent time inputting was gone.     I emailed macXware (because there is no customer support phone number), and they told me I had to install an update. I did, and again, everything seemed to be working. I then repeated all of the entries I had made, ran reports, everything seemed to be fine.    Too good to be true. Once I quit the program and reopened it, everything was gone--AGAIN!     Now, I've emailed the tech support, again, but I've gotten no response. Since that is the only option to request support  it looks like I'm fat out of luck, and several hours of my busy day.     I'm furious with the false promises made by this product, and I highly recommend avoiding the frustration I've experiences by not purchasing this item.	2008-02-22

Peter Norton was the savior of many a computer user and consultant.  There were few programs that I absolutely depended upon more than Norton Utilities but somewhere between 2002 and 2004 that all changed.  The program was probably rewritten from scratch to accommodate Windows XP. <br /> <br />After Peter Norton sold it to the \\"slicks\\", the \\"meat\\" started disappearing, but it still worked ... sorta.  Code bloat became really ugly and new versions often had only cosmetic differences.    The worse that happened before 2003 was that some very useful aspects of it such as the hardware diagnostics and disk editing modules were pulled with neither explanation nor alternative offerings. <br /> <br />Now it no longer works well.  I have had many a virgin installation crash and worse than that: <br />1 - You could not reinstall it <br />2 - You could not uninstall it <br />3 - Norton wanted $35 before they would even talk to you even if you had only had the product for a half hour <br />4 - You could not get a refund <br />5 - and the mail in rebate for the overpriced version, well let's not even go there! <br /> <br />Norton produced serveral little fix it tools.  I did not use them all but the ones I did use did not work completely.  They cleaned up some of the problems but not them all.  Since then, to solve the problems it has caused, I've either had to spend a few hours of registry editing or wipe the machine and restart. <br /> <br />I do not believe that Symantec hires only incompetent programmers.  I do believe that the company is probably run by shortsighted stockholders who know nothing about the business but only want to maximize the bottom line.  Squeezing out highly competent and probably expensive employees has resulted in a dramatic decrease in product quality.  Once again short term gains will kill a once valuable product.  There are many quality alternatives that I'll look over while listening to the death knell increase in intensity of a ex-industry leader.	2005-12-03

I like the fact that it comes with a manual, not too many cheaper digital art programs do this.

Customer service, while more geared toward selling you something, does eventually answer all your questions related to the actual product, which is very important to the new digital artist.<br />Overall, I like it and would recommend it to someone just starting out.

The first is myself, a 40 something who took Spanish in high school for 3 years, spent a summer in South America (and emerged fluent from that experience) but now am quite rusty.  I still understand a great deal of Spanish, but have lost my ability to speak it.  The second is my 12 year old son, who has had one year of fairly intensive Spanish over the previous school year.  The third is my 9 year old daughter, her previous Spanish only a few words gleaned from Dora the Explorer.<br /><br />Both of my kids have to earn TV or video game time over the summer.  They  earn it by reading or playing educational computer games.  I offered this program as a choice when it arrived and both have chosen to do Rosetta Stone for about 80% of the overall required time.  Obviously they enjoy it, but would not chose it over playing on the video game console.<br /><br /> Both kids have been using the microphone.  I feel this is a strong point of the program since my kids really do not hear native speakers with the other Spanish Language Program we have (Eazyspeak Spanish ) .  The microphone option has several choices for how closely you have to match the correct pronunciation in order to \\"pass\\".  I have it adjusted higher for my son and lower for my daughter.  I also had to adjust the speaker volume from the control panel of the computer (use Start- Control Panel - Sounds and Audio Devices).  For the 12 year old with one year of Spanish, starting about halfway though level one was appropriate.<br /><br />For myself Level 1 was too easy.  At level 2 I found that I was \\"relearning\\" some things (especially matching noun and verb type) that I had forgotten.  The program is visually pleasant,  good quality photos, and a good mix of types of teaching such as listening to a phrase and picking the correct photo,  repeating phrases,  having to come up with your own phrases to describe the photos,  typing answers.<br /><br />I find the audio companion very useful, it is helping me drag the forgotten Spanish out of my brain.  The kids do not like it at all,  I think the lack of visual feedback is frustrating for them but it could also be that they prefer the \\"books on cd\\" we usually listen to when traveling in the car.<br /><br />My son had been using \\"Eazyspeak Spanish\\" before Rosetta stone.  This is also a good program for learning basic vocabulary (if you just want to go to Mexico and be able to ask for the bathroom, or chose menu items) but it does not give you any feedback about your pronunciation.  Be aware, the Eazyspeak  program does teach all sorts of names for alcoholic drinks and has some innuendos.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone is a great way to learn basic Spanish, much closer to how you \\"naturally\\" learn. However, I do not thing you will be \\"fluent\\" after finishing the program, but you will be able to get your basic messages across and navigate more easily when on vacation.<br /><br />It is fantastic as a supplement to a beginning Spanish classes and a great way for kids to start learning another language.  I plan on having my daughter finish all the lessons before she starts taking Spanish in school, it should give her a good solid foundation.<br /><br />***UPDATE<br /><br />My son went back to school 3 weeks ago.  I got an email from his teacher this week saying that my son had really improved his pronunciation over the summer and had remembered more of his vocabulary than the rest of the class.  He asked me if what we did with him over the summer and I told him that my son had done Eazy Speak Spanish for a month and then Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />**One year update<br /><br /> We are still using this software on a weekly basis.  During the summer I have my teenage son (who is taking Spanish in school) use Rosetta Stone.  It is very helpful in retaining vocabulary.  My 10 year old daughter has been working her way through the program as well,  she should start out her first Spanish class with a good grasp of some of the basics.  They enjoy the program, so it does not take much pushing to get them to use it.some of the basics.  They enjoy the program, so it does not take much pushing to get them to use it.	2008-08-08

I already know how to use photoshop so have no problems with this version.  If you are new to photoshop, there are so many different techniques and tools in it that a good user tutorial book might be very helpful to use, or you will miss much in how to use this program.<br /><br />This version of Photoshop Elements seems better integrated with the Mac and takes up less space than my previous version.  In particular it integrates well with iPhoto, unlike previously.  However, it often crashes when attempting to open it.  I don't know if this is some idiosyncrasy with my own system or flakiness in the software itself.  Once successfully launched, it works fine.  However, note that there are more inexpensive image editing programs out there.<br /><br />What bothers me about this version is the incredibly long installation process.  It took several minutes of mysterious hard disc churning, during which it is hard to tell what is happening.  Is it indexing my photo library?  Is it installing lots and lots of little clip art files that I'm not interested in?  Is it sending the contents of my hard disk back to the mother ship?  I really dislike this \\"black box\\" approach to installation during which the alert or inquisitive software owner is kept completely ignorant.  I almost considered giving it a three-star rating is due to this very annoying installation process, which has left me wondering what it has done to my hard disk.	2010-03-24

I have had PowerDirector for more than a year and am now on my third version. I upgraded from PowerDirector 11. Before that I had version 10.<br /><br />I keep upgrading because the program is so important to me - not because of some new feature that I must have. I had used Adobe Premiere ( the full version) for several years. But then my video needs gradually diminished and I got newer machines. I had no non-linear editor on my PC at all. Then when I  launched my new video project I had to choose a new editor.<br /><br />My first instinct was for Adobe Premiere but I wanted to buy the less expensive cut-down version. I downloaded the trial version and tried to use it. When I had used the full version of Premiere I had always had stability problems. I used to save my work often because it would occasionally freeze up and I would have to re-boot. The Premiere Elements version did this even more often. The Sony Vegas download trial wouldn't even load. So I turned to the product - PowerDirector - that while it got good reviews, was unknown to me. It runs like a train. It never crashes.<br /><br />I make video lectures that I mount on YouTube. I make one a week. That's a very ambitious schedule. Everything has to work if I am to keep grinding out a new movie every week. I need software reliability. PowerDirector gives it to me.<br /><br />I shoot in raw AVI. I only compress the movie down to WMV or YouTube at the very end. I have a lot of intermediate steps in my production process. I have to be careful to maintain the best quality as long as possible. This means I work with very large video files. I twenty minute video will run more than a hundred gigabytes. Each segment is typically five or ten gigabytes.<br /><br />Fortunately my machine is a Win 7 PC with 64 bit processing and a i5 processor. I have a lot of RAM and a lot of hard disk. PowerDirector has no trouble with my giant files and it renders everything quite quickly.<br /><br />But best of all - it never burps. It handles everything I throw at it with no complaints.<br /><br />There are a couple areas where it could be improved. My microphone is buried behind my teleprompter. And the teleprompter has a black cloth hood. That means the high frequencies are muted which hurts intelligibility. So this week I decided to re-equalize the audio in post-production. Next week I'm going to use another mic.<br /><br />Cyberlink's audio tracks can be manipulate a little. They have control buttons that let you adjust the volume but you cannot impose an equalization profile on a track within the program. I had to strip each audio track out (quite easy) and adjust it outside of the program in Sound Forge. It's also easy to reattach the new crisper audio track but all those steps take time. I would like some future version to beef up the audio processing.<br /><br />ERRATUM: (10/23/13) The previous comment is all wrong. I just didn't know how to use the Audio Editor. My bad. The stock version of PowerDirector works like a dream on adding audio equalization in post production. I got the trial version of Cyberlink's AudioDirector but I don't need that much control.<br /><br />I film in green screen and PowerDirector has an easy to use Chroma key facility. I use it on all my videos for the layer where I add the 'corner bug'. For these type of uses, it couldn't be better. But it is not really up to snuff on developing a chroma key for a live human. It just doesn't have enough controls to give a realistic matte. The state of the art in chroma keying software for the prosumer is probably Adobe After Effects. But at $700 a copy it's too much money for me. I use a copy of Serious Magic's Ultra II. This is the product and technology for which Adobe bought the company about five years ago.

I have extensively used 2004 (Premium) and decided to opt for 2005 (Deluxe). We're now in 2007. Many may wonder why (a) I downgraded from Premium to Deluxe (b) Why I didn't buy 2006 or 2007. Here's why: <br />Premium functionality essentially revolves around providing a more complete tax-saving/calculation work platform. Other than that - deluxe vs. premium are the same. I use online and/or specialized tax products which are almost always free and upto date and available just before the tax-return period. Those I found are better to a huge extent. <br />Next, post extensive evaluation (thru reviews posted by others, MS itself) I realized that 2006 is essentially a wash-out by MS, in terms of re-packaging the same software with a diff. name. All it did was to address some glitches, etc. in 2005 version. Additionally, patches available today for 2005 already addresses these glitches. Now - 2007 is a diff. ball-game altogether. The problem is that it requires a NEW type of login called LiveID; which I find quite frustrating and un-neccessary. The additional 2 new budget capabilities are very small enhancements to worth the dough. Net effect - I got the 2005 today for USD 9.00 whereas I would have shelled out additional $40.00 if I had purchased 2006 or 2007. <br /> <br />REVIEW OF THE SOFTWARE - Well, it's definitely a BIG, BIG plus to be able to have online and constant updates directly from Money. That's a big plus. Certain banks like BOA charge for that service (9.95) while for others it's free (ex.: Citibank). The number of banks, credit-card companies are EXTENSIVE. Money 2005+ uses Yoddle Inc. for these online services. The general look and feel is also much better than 2004. They removed sub-categories; but there's a patch available (registry entry) which re-introduces it. Quick navigation, speed, etc. are another plus. They also removed MoneyExpress - which was actually a bad thing for me; since I didn't have to open the whole Money to enter in registry. Referring to MS web-site it seems that there were too many complaints and issues (but I personally never faced any). <br />The portfolio manager has been tremendously revamped and is really powerful. Not upto the capabilities of any dedicated investment software; however those cost also a ton! The budget/report/etc. are un-changed but useful. <br />MS should seriously start thinking of supporting foreign banks too. That's a big minus for Money 2005(+) and it's the same for all versions.  <br /> <br />In terms of bad points - (a) Even after online update, the next day the same transactions re-appear as requiring reconcilliation. That even if I mark them as Cleared/Reconcilled/etc.  <br />(b) Transfer of funds between bank accounts - generally always have a delay (lag-time between debit at 1 account, credit to another). That should be an option to introduct by user. Otherwise, the statements start to mis-match, esp. when online updates. You change the date in 1 - the other gets also affected, etc. <br />(c) The budgets/etc. when you attempt to build bases itself on avg. monthly income. That's a very, very wrong way since I may be having a standard salary coming in every month but I also have a bonus once an year. If I add that bonus (estimated); what Money does is it breaks that in 12 months immediately and adds to the overall monthly pool. Also, it starts the budget from the date you built the budget. What if I have a special reason to start a budget and follow it (say) from 1st. of March 20xxx. That's not possible. <br />(d) The insurance types are incomplete (life insurance section). <br />(e) MSN Bill Pay services take Helluva long time to deliver the draft.	2006-09-21

It is hard to understand why, after all these years of computer and software development in many areas, this &quot;Library of The Future CD ROM&quot; is the only effort that can be considered of any value, to comprise into CD ROM media the work of many authors. By now, one would have thought that CD's will be available with the complete works of authors from all countries and eras. I understand that copyright is an issue, but still, there is serious money to be made in preparing an assortment of CD's, in different lenguages that include pratically all the literary work of value in the world. In this particular case of the &quot;Library of the Future&quot;, the software interface is poor, but the reader will have in just one CD ROM more than 5,000 literary pieces, including very hard to find works by greek poets and other ancient authors. A commendable effort that needs someone with the resources to do a serious follow up.	2001-07-05

Upgraded to 2014 so I could use the app. It's decent, but not intuitive in how to enter transactions on the app. Particularly frustrating is trying to overwrite the payee - I type in the name and it reverts back to a predefined default, multiple times. Also it would be nice if you could change accounts when entering a transaction. If you are entering a credit card transaction, and then realize that you're in your checking account; you must cancel the transaction, open the credit card account, and start over. I do like the ability to add a photo of the receipt. Getting step-by-step instructions for using the app is very limited, and not helpful - I'm figuring it out by trial and error, and then trying to remember exactly what I did when it finally works. Overall like the app and, if I had it to do over again, I would make the purchase.	2014-01-12

I was worried about the integrity of my data when I read some of these reviews, but my worries were unfounded.  I backed up all of my Quicken data files to an external hard drive, then from the time I inserted the Quicken 2010 Premier DVD into my computer until the time program started was less than 15 minutes.  During that time, Quicken 07 Deluxe was removed, Quicken 10 Premier installed and updated itself, and about 110,000 transactions were converted into the new format - that's 19 years worth of data including all accounts, investments, mutual fund updates - the works.    I like the new home page, which is only subtly different from Quicken 07.  There are now some customizable tabs at the top which you can click to rapidly get to other views.  All of my old reports were accurately retained, and it looks like there are some new overview reports I can elect to place on overview pages.    I do not download information directly from banks or brokerages since I'm very reluctant to give my secure passwords to any program, so I can't comment on the ability of this program (or Quicken 07, for that matter) to download information from financial institutions.    Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, which works perfectly on Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit.	2010-01-21

McAfee Antivirus Plus 2011 seemingly does a good job of preventing infections, intrusions, etc. However, McAfee has apparently decided that the fact that you have purchased a license to use their software gives them a license to employ direct marketing for some of their other products through the use of pop-up messages even when you do not have a browser open. It is the same type of practice utilized by \\"shareware\\" and downloaded \\"trial\\" software. These pop-up ads are rather large. They have been as large as 3 x 5 inches on my 24 inch monitor. There seems to be no way to disable these annoyances. You may also receive, by the same method, notices to \\"renew\\" your current license. This supposedly can be resolved by clicking \\"Verify Subscription\\". It is not always 100% effective however.    If you don't mind the annoyances mentioned above McAfee is a good choice. Personally, I will be looking at Internet security software from other publishers.	2010-11-02

My workstation previously ran Windows 2000 Pro before I installed Vista Ultimate.  Unfortunately, Vista in certain cases will only run applications made to run under Vista; Nero and Norton Antivirus are two that I needed to upgrade.  Some of the other applications continued to run after downloading the vendor provided version update/upgrade for Vista.    My use of Nero 6 was limited to creating and backing up video DVDs and music CDs; I use another product for video editing and formatting.  In spite of my limited use of Nero, I was very pleased with the depth of features in Nero 8.  I may be using more features in the future due to the many improvements over Nero 6.    Nero is an essential product for those of us who are running Vista due to the over zealous DRM built into Vista.  For one thing, Vista will not duplicate media without a DRM signature on the media;  I believe all media created pre-DRM fall into this category.  Hopefully, Microsoft will release a update to fix the DRM problem; until then, I'm glad there are products like Nero 8.	2008-02-28

I've been a user of of both PSP and Adobe since the 90's and an X3 user since October.  The X3 software itself is fantastic.  While Elements is the de facto for home photo editing, it is difficult to learn beyond the standard automated features, even for those with reasonable intelligence and experience.  All operating systems provide minimal photo editing capabilities, so if you don't perform any advance tasks, save yourself the money and use what you already have built in.  However, if you want to take your editing a step further, you cannot beat the ease of use nor the price of PSP X3.  Photoshop Elements and PSP X3 do roughly the exact same thing. To compare functionality and output would be a waste of time as I'd be comparing apples to apples.  The important differentiating factor is how you get there - for the average home user or hobbyist, PSP X3 will give you the output your looking for without the need to spend hours trying to figure out one little feature.    In regard to the issue with the license agreement - When I came across this deal this morning, I curiously checked out the reviews and was shocked with what I read - I'm an ACCEPT first and read later kind of guy, like most of us.  Rather than jump to conclusions, I did my due dilligence and discovered that the small program that X3 installs and communicates with the outside world does so in order to make sure that your license agreement is valid.  It checks for software updates.  It also transmits information about your online habits without transmitting any identifying information at all.  This can easily be diabled.  This is no different than what Google, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Adobe, Amazon, ATT, Verison, Comcast, etc. etc. do.  ATT tracks all your iPhone web usage.  Verizon and Android do it with Google.  In fact, they both use the numbers you call and those that call you as marketing devices - you call a bunch of photo stores in a month?  Guess what?  Next month you'll get a coupleof subtle emails from Ritz or Best Buy or Amazon suggesting you look at some photographic equipment they're selling.  It's these types of efficiencies that allow corporations to dedicate R&D money to the proper place, market to the appropriate people and ultimately, keep prices as low as possible for the consumer.  Big companies do not steal your passwords and credit card information.      There is no doubt that EVERY personal computer has software programs installed that communicate with the outside world. Go ahead and take the time to read the license agreement of every piece of software on your computer - Java, Flash, etc.  The only way to guarantee yourself privacy online is to shut your computer off...  The only way to guarantee your privacy anywhere is to live in the woods!    PSP X3 is a great piece of software.  It does exactly what you want and does so with relative ease.  Amazon is practically giving it away and because of one review, folks who never even tried it are leaving bad reviews based on wording in the licensing terms that quite frankly, they know nothing about - neither did I until a short time ago.  Do yourself a favor, take 10 minutes and do your due dilligence and you'll learn a lot.  Once you're done, you'll get yourself a great little software program for a steal!

If you use the Payroll Tax service, BEWARE: Just a few years ago it was $50 annually to subscribe to the payroll tax service.  In 1999 it went up to $79.  Then in 2001 it doubled to $149.  In 2003 it went to $169 and in 2004 they have just announced they are raising it to $199 annually.  Each time they remind you that \\"it's still a great value!\\"  (Peachtree plays this same game).  On top of that, they retire (\\"sunset\\") old versions every 2 to 3 years.  So expect to buy Quickbooks 4-5 times over the next 10 years.

The TurboTax Basic model seems to do everything the more expensive versions do, at a fraction of their cost.  The program makes a number of attempts to get the user to upgrade to more expensive versions of TurboTax programs and it is entirely possible that an upgrade would be time-saving.  But if cost is a prime factor in one's decision making, the basic model seems to be a good choice.	2013-01-01

I would check with him from time to time, and he seemed to be very much into the game, trying to identify the keys on the keyboard. He plays on a computer at home almost daily, but this was the first time I saw him preoccupied learning the keyboard.<br /><br />The box I got contains three CD, as opposed to only two advertised in this package. The other two are called \\"Spellbound\\" and \\"Writing Practice\\". Out of them, only the \\"Typing\\" CD worked on a PowerBook running MacOS X 10.4 (a PowerPC processor). The other two sadly require MacOS 9 to be installed. While this might be fine for a PowerPC-based machine, it won't work on the new Intel-based Macs. The typing CD seems to be running fine on a new MacPro Intel-based system.<br /><br />One thing which is really bothersome is the fact the software requires the original CD to be inserted in order to run. I guess the reason is to protect from piracy, but is this really working? For paying customers, their small kids are going to always ask their parent's help before playing the game. This will only reduce the time the kids spend with the software, as CDs are often misplaced and hard to find later. Why require this for a less than $20 program? There are so many other ways to make this work, the developers should really investigate them.	2006-09-10

Please read this!  I have Norton Internet Security 2010.  I upgraded in September 2009, because as other reviewers have said, if You have Norton and your subscription runs out, you'll be left with nothing.  Anyway, I got a virus on my pc yesterday that prompted me to go to a website and order Internet Security 2010.  I was sceptical of doing this because I was already paying Norton.  I clicked on the Norton icon on my pc and it took me to their 1 click support screen.  There I was able to connect to a chat room.  The person said they knew about the virus and that it was good I didn't order the software, and said they would be glad to help me get rid of it for $99.  I argued that I already paid Norton to protect my pc and they said that was the only way they could help outside of giving me instructions that it would take a professional pc person to follow.  Since it had already taken me a couple of hours to get into a chat session with them and they threatened that if I got out of the session, I would have to start over again, I paid the $99. Then the person said they would refer me to a tech who would fix my pc.  I waited about 1/2 hour and no one came back to the chat session to help me.  I then went to Microsoft support and got into a chat session right away.  The tech stayed with me the entire time and fixed my pc for FREE!!!  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM SYMANTEC.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT OR SOMEWHERE IN INDIA, BECAUSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PERSON I WAS TALKING TO.(at some point they had to call me on the phone because my pc kept shutting down windows explorer)  I attempted to contact them for a refund for the $99, but I have not been able to find anywhere that I can send an email or get a number to request a refund.  Also, ever since I upgrated to 2010 I've been getting constant email spam.  They should leave out all the fancy bells and whistles and concentrate on protecting your pc from viruses and preventing spam.  My next stop isthe better business bureau.	2010-01-26

And anyone who has \\"gone legit\\" knows the headaches stop when you actually buy it.  I'm 22 years old and since getting my first computer at age 15 I've run bootleg copies of windows.  And all of my computers had problems.  So finally I decided I wanted to build a new computer. And part of the budget I made for myself is that I bought a sparkling new legit copy of Windows XP.  I have NEVER had a problem with it so far.  I'm even running dual operating systems with the Windows Vista BETA build, and that hasn't crashed yet either.   <br /> <br />So in short as I'm reviewing Windows Live OneCare I have to ask how many of you are running a pirated copy of Windows?  Because it works great on a legit copy. The backup function is very nice.  Other programs have it too, but on One Care it's very easy.  If you have the right hardware it'll even do it all for you.  You can go to work or school and come home with a backup DVD.  I have a DVD and a CD burner; I can even set it up to burn one of each in two separate drives.  It takes far less memory to run than McAfee, which is what I was running before.  And the true reason I got OneCare is because when I was running the Internet Explorer 7 BETA, McAfee doesn't support it.  The interface is easy to use, as it is a Windows product.  If you can navigate the Windows interface you can navigate the OneCare interface.  Also it's nice that your security program also performs maintenance such as when you defragment your hard drive as part of the process.  So in conclusion, run straight out Windows with straight out OneCare and you'll be fine.  If you are a Windows hater, you'll probably give this product 1 star because of the namesake.  Just remember the reason that most of you have your problems is because you won't just go buy a real working product. <br /> <br />Cons (Negatives first) <br />-49.99 is pretty expensive, but it covers 3 PCs and McAfee was costing me 39.99 <br />-Not really a Con, but if you are running bootleg Windows it won't work well for you <br />-Security advisement can cause unstable programs to crash. Example: Playing a game with an unstable modification locked up my computer <br /> <br />Pros <br />-Easy interface, easy to use <br />-Internet Explorer 7 BETA support <br />-Runs smoother than McAfee, AVAST!, Zone Alarm.  Uses less memory and runs smoother in the background <br />	2006-08-05

Even the machine performance degraded after installation. Prior to installation, speed wise, the computer would average 1100+ on pc pit stops performance test. Now, it averages 950+. Go figure...<br />     Functionality is basically the same as Office 2000 with one exception, Photo Draw has been removed from Office XP. (One less useable app, more money for Ofc XP). The  graphics in each app is improved in Ofc XP, but what does that really provide?<br />     If you already have Office 2000 Pro, do not upgrade to Ofc XP Pro. Office XP Pro is definately not worth the additional $$$.<BR>The only gain apparent is the improved graphic interface, but even that is not much, and not all that.	2003-01-03

Here's 4 simple steps I used to make Win 8 run more like Win 7.  I learned about these simple tweaks that have improved my Win 8 experience:<br /><br />- Bring back the Start Menu by installing Classic Shell, it's free and available from SourceForge. Works like a charm. I even set a custom Start button. Cool!<br /><br />- Boot Directly to Desktop and skip that pesky app page with all the tiles.  Just another cool feature of Classic Shell that I like.<br /><br />- Skip the Login Screen -- just reset your user password.  When it prompts you for the new password, leave the fields blank, and Apply, and this will eliminate the need to input a password on bootup.  It'll just go straight to your desktop (via Classic Shell) automatically.<br /><br />- Bring Back Desktop Gadgets with 8GadgetPack. it's free.  Just install it, and you'll have all your fave Windows 7 Gadgets back and available to use on Win 8.<br /><br />That's it!  The other reviews here have done a good job describing the ins and outs of Win 8, so I thought I'd just share these specific tips.  I was very frustrated with Win 8 until I installed these tweaks, and now I'm a happy camper.  Win 8 without these tweaks is 3 stars.  Win 8 with these tweaks is a 5 star for me. Good luck! ;oD	2013-06-07

While still relatively new to the wonderful world of computer animation, I've nevertheless been able to become resonably proficient in a number of programs in a short amount of time.  I've learned Animation Master, Poser, Bryce, and Vue, and will soon be learning Carrara Pro, which by all accounts is wonderful and easy to use.  While I'm not a master at any of these, each program has been easier to learn than the one before it.  <br /> <br />I bought Shade 7 because it is sold by Curious Labs, the same people who produce Poser.  They advertise it as  \\"companion software\\" to Poser (Poser fusion), and they offered it for half off with my Poser serial number. I naturally assumed that it would have a similar interface and controls as Poser. <br /> <br />WRONG!  Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!  Shade was developed in Japan, by a completely different team of programmers.  The only thing it has in common with Poser is that it was bought out by Curios Labs, who now market it.  Poser fusion?  I don't get it.  Any 3d modellling software that will allow you to export into DXF, 3DS, or OBJ can be used to create props for Poser, so this is NOT a strong selling point.  Importing Poser characters?  Vue and Carrara Pro will allow you to import the entire animation! <br /> <br />So, how is the software?  Let me just say that Shade is about the most UN-user friendly software I've ever attempted to use!  People who are used to doing 90 percent of their work by pointing and clicking with a mouse will be instantly turned off.  Not only are keyboard commands used as shortcuts, THEY'RE MANDATORY!  I'm not kidding.  Even simple commands like moving the camera or rotating your model require you to memorize which key (or KEYS) to hold down while dragging your mouse.  Keep in mind, this is just to do basic functions that should be intuitive. <br /> <br />Try doing a simple boolean function.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  In Vue or Bryce, its so ridiculouslysimple that a four year old could do it.  In Shade?  Go into the PDF manual that comes with the software and try to decifer it.  It gave me a splitting headache just trying to make sense of it.  Who wrote this manual?  Maybe its just a literal traslation from the Japanese one. <br /> <br />I'm sure that a person who's proficient in Shade can make stunning 3d models.  The free models that come with the software are also useful, so its not a complete waste of money.  The \\"magical draw\\" software is quite useful.  For these reasons, I give it two stars.  As far as actually using Shade to create models to populate my 3d universe?  Forget it!  I just want to make movies. I don't have time for this crap!	2005-03-09

(This review is actually a copy and paste of one of my previous comments)<br /><br />Not winning at windows? Calm down buddy it's not that bad. To really win at using windows 8 you should have a touch screen display so upgrade if you can.<br />However if you can't upgrade to a touchscreen monitor or laptop all is not lost. The following 10 tips should help you warm up to windows 8.<br /><br />1.) If you're on a desktop pc, investing in a touch keyboard (maybe like the logitech K400) and swiping 1 or 2 fingers at a time may produce a better experience than attacking it with a mouse.<br /><br />2.) If you're using a laptop or touch keyboard start on the trackpad at the far right midway from the top and swipe left with one finger to bring up the settings/time feature or using 2 fingers together swipe up down left or right to mimic touch screen swipe navigation<br /><br />3.) If you're on a laptop that doesn't have a touch screen the smoothness of the track pad is critical to achieving the best experience. Heavily textured trackpads like the one on the Dell inspiron 14 will cause tiny hops when your finger tips swipe on it and cause multiple double clicks instead of swipes causing you to drag stuff around or open things you did not intend to... you don't want that nightmare. (come to think of it this may apply to the logitech touch as well so buy over the counter and check the smoothness to be sure)<br /><br />4.) Try to avoid using windows 8 till it completes the automatic updates which corrects most of the really horrific stuff like not being able to safely remove a USB flash drive or even have the system indicate that one has been plugged in. In windows 8 those first automatic updates are VERY CRITICAL.<br /><br />5.) Give yourself time to warm up to the new interface. Microsoft has essentially made most of its traditional features that were previously accessible via 1 click now require 2 clicks to access. As long as you can accept that it takes twice as long to get to where you're used to going with 1 click you'll hate windows 8 (and hotmail) a tiny bit less. Just remember you can place items within 1 click reach by adding live tile shortcuts or desktop shortcuts.<br /><br />6.) Take the time to get familiar with the location of critical programs by right clicking on the live tile screen and selecting \\"all apps\\" and then scrolling all the way to the right. Many things you think aren't there are actually there.<br /><br />7.) If you haven't noticed yet the menu that slides out from the right (also displaying the time on the left) has less options for settings in live tile view compared to desktop view which is one of the things I will never warm up to. This is also true for internet explorer in desktop mode vs live tile mode. You're pretty much better off with the desktop version of everything if you want the most features.<br /><br />8.)Powering up after a full shutdown takes longer than microsoft says, and your eyes may also want to confirm their claims, but when you logon and the live tile menu is displayed, the system still needs another 5  or more seconds to fully load the desktop and (swipe accessed) pop up menus in the background. Even though it appears to be fully loaded I've found that the 5 second wait is worth it to avoid glitched navigation issues.<br /><br />9.)If you've ever formatted and done a clean windows install of previous versions, you may notice that when the desktop loads for the first time, the start menu is open. Windows 8 simply does this by default every time the system boots up, but because the start menu is now full screen, and you have to right click and select \\"all apps\\" instead of just clicking once to go to \\"programs\\" as before, people think it's vastly different, but the concept is the same. Just like hitting the escape key will return you from the start menu to the desktop, hitting the escape key in windows 8 will also close the full screen start menu and return you to the desktop.<br /><br />10.) Customize your desktop.  You can still right click on your desktop and select \\"personalize\\" and then select \\"change desktop icons\\" to restore easy access to \\"my computer\\" etc. Also if you download and install a program that doesn't automatically place a shortcut on the desktop such as Gimp 2.8, you can still create the shortcut by right clicking on the gimp tile in your start menu and selecting go to \\"program location\\" which takes you to an explorer (file navigator) window, where you can either copy the gimp shortcut to your desktop from one pane (with a right click and drag or right click and send to desktop)  or switch to the other pane and create the shortcut from the executable program file itself. Really cool to be honest.<br /><br />The big thing to wrap your head around is that the windows 8 concept is one of taking the traditional start menu and making it full screen, with much larger dynamic icons that are very functional, instead of just static start menu shortcut links. To make the live tile icons as functional as they are the live tile start menu now remains open in full screen mode unless you close it. Maybe a tad bit of an oversimplification but I hope that it adds some missing perspective.10.) Customize your desktop.

This is not about being \\"reluctant to change\\"...it's anger at being required to take much longer, 4 times more clicks to do what you used to do, and learning new ways of doing things that are no better or faster than the old.  When you use 2007 for several months, as I have, it becomes clear that a lot of the changes make no sense or are crude, simplistic replications of the old functionality which was more capable and easier to use.  Some changes appear to have no reason other than to give something a slicker look - but work worse.  The pivot chart wizard is a perfect example.  I used to be able to make powerful, customized pivot charts.  If you thought pivot charts were a little tricky before, you'll find they're impossible now.    As others have said, hang on to 2003 as long as you can, then move on to Open Office.  Microsoft is putting a brave face on this and are committed to their direction (I know some employees).  There are too many egos and careers involved now, so forget about hoping they'll re-evaluate, do a mea culpa and change direction.	2010-12-15

That said, I've seen the system grow larger, more unstable and less secure with each new version. WinXP is no better, although everyone seems to tout how great it is. Ask any 12 year old hacker and they'll tell you just how easy it is to hack or write a virus for it.<br />Now, I'm not a total stranger to Mandrake, having briefly used version 7 a couple of years ago. I installed it two weeks before I sold the PC. I was so impressed with Mandrake I told all my friends about it. Unfortunately for me, I built my next PC and some of my hardware wasn't supported by Mandrake, so I dropped it.<br />Fast-forward to today. I got a copy of Mandrake 9.2 and installed it. I'm just as impressed with it now as I was three years ago. The GUI (graphic user interface for newbies) is crisp and clean, and reminds me of Macintosh graphics. The menus are very easy to use, as well as configure. This is one of the more flexible aspects of Linux. Windows never will give you the kind of flexibility that Linux does.<br />When it comes to stability at security, there's not much better out there. Linux stability goes without saying. We're always hearing about people who run linux systems for months without a reboot. These stories are not only fantastic, they're generally true as well. In fact, it's not unheard of for a system to be up for a year or more without a reboot.<br />With rock-solid firewalls, Linux systems are much more secure than MS based systems. The administrator (root) password can be entered if you're making a configuration change, without having to be logged in as such. This makes quick changes to the system fast and painless. User accounts are also more configurable than Windows systems because user accounts can be tailored per program. i.e. One user may have a higher level of program access than another, while a third could be an admin for that program. <br />Because Linux is open-source, there are literally thousands of people looking at the very code the programs are made up of. If they see any vulnerability in the system, it's changed immediately. This is an inherent problem with MS, as they have only a small number of software engineers who actually see the code. The more people look at a problem, the more likely it is to be solved.<br />Mandrake has done some good things with the kernel (base Linux program) by adding their own flair. The purchased versions of Mandrake come with some excellent software like VMWare, which allows you to install Windows in a Mandrake 'subsystem'. You lose some performance because Windows runs in a Linux 'Window', but I think it's worth it.<br />The program comes with the install CDs (7) which contain the OS and literally thousands of programs to make using Mandrake complete. It also comes with a starter guide to help you get up and running. The only thing I'd like to see in this pack is the reference manual that's included with the Pro version. This book contains lots of information that should be readily available to all users, not just the pros. Online documentation is also difficult to sort through in a pinch. Still, I can't give it less than 5 stars for the reasons I've outlined.<br />Summary: It's easy to install and configure. It's ultra reliable and secure. It's inexpensive. All-in-all, it's a great program.	2004-02-25

You will have to download all programs for a second time, but you can take all your documents, pictures, game data, etc. and put them back in their respectful place in your new system. Great way to work things windows. And the dealer was right on time. I received my item within 4 days (4-7 was the given estimate) when another item had taken 8 when the given estimate was 3-6. Highly satisfied with my new version of windows and the great reliability of the dealer.	2014-06-08

It was the first visual editor I felt comfortable with after doing hand-coding for many years.  I thought it was time to give myself a break and just layout pages visually - a process I've become very accustomed to over the past, oh, five years.<br />I purchased MXStudio 2004 because I wanted to learn Flash and to get a new version of Fireworks - those alone were probably worth my $200.  The Mac OS X version of Dreamweaver, however, is absolutely horrific.  It's slower than Classic, slower than MX... it's just impossibly slow.  In testing, I've found a web page to take 8 seconds from double-clicking it to being able to edit it.  Resizing a window takes 2.5 seconds on average.  This is all on a fairly quick iMac G4 running at 800MHz, with Mac OS X 10.3.2, the newest version of the operating system, installed.<br />The new features are nice - pasting in styled text from MS Word is extremely handy when many of your clients use that program (like mine).  This is the first Mac OS X-native version of Dreamweaver I've used, so not starting up Classic is a huge benefit.  <br />If Macromedia can figure out where the sluggishness is happening (and actually fix it!) , I'd be a much happier web designer.  I just want a quick WYSIWYG web page editor that supports CSS well (Dreamweaver always has); the lack of speed with which this program carries out its tasks is seriously detrimental to my productivity, though.  Doing a series of copying and pasting in notes from Word to Dreamweaver is just dog-slow... and it's not because Word is lagging on me.<br />Wait for an update, then see if things are better.<br />Edit: an update, 7.0.1, is now available.  Macromedia touts it as the biggest incremental update to a program ever.  I have to say it really does speed up the process.  The program doesn't feel as lithe as shareware Cocoa programs designed for one app, but I doubt it would ever feel quite that good.<br />Overall, this update easily ups my score 1 star, and more likely, 1 and a half stars.  Since we can't rate my half stars, I'm going to go out on a limb and increase my rating from its previous 2 stars to 4, because Macromedia seems to have tried so hard - and really delivered the goods with this update.	2004-02-12

I bought this to help me study for my college Spanish course and  it helped a lot. The two parts of the program A+ Spanish and Spanish Before You Know It work perfectly together. A+ Spanish gave me 15 lessons in Spanish on my computer and really gave me a good basis of understanding the Spanish Language. Spanish Before You Know It saved me on studying for those tests. It is a flashcard program that contains thousands of Spanish vocabulary words in different categories. With these two tools I was able to comprehend and learn way more Spanish than I thought I could. I would recomend this program to anyone who wants to learn to Spanish for any reason- business, school, travel ect.	2003-06-03

Had a catastrophic failure and loss of my system and reloaded Windows on a fresh disc, loaded Novastor, which I had been using for backups for years, and It told me that I had to purchase an upgrade since my current version had expired (News to me!). Well, I needed my system because I had a fairly recent Novastor total disc backup, so I ordered the upgrade on my wife's system, installed the downloaded new Novastor on my system' and mounted the backup disc and proceeded to restore my system. KABOOM! The new version did not recognize the old version's backup. I emailed Novastor about the problem and tried various scenarios they suggested for 2 days and nothing worked. After 2 days, Novastor stopped answering my requests for help.<br /><br />Found a several months old disc that I had cloned with an older copy of Acronis True Image so I mounted the disc in my system and it took right off. Back in business but I had lost months of data and activity such as emails and downloaded data. Thoroughly disgusted with Novastor, I ordered a new 2014 version of Acronis and tossed everything I had from Novastor. No more of that, ever!!!<br /><br />I am happily back in business with 'Acronis True Image 2014' now and everything is running fine. I am now ectremely happy with Acronis and I highly recommend it to anyone.	2014-05-28

Graphics STILL cannot be selected in multiples (the Hallmark rep said you would be able to).  You must select one graphic, paste it to your project, go back and select the second graphic, paste it, etc.  Graphics cannot be edited either (again the Hallmark rep said they could be)--not even to crop out a small portion.  The rep said they now had a photo editor that can be used on graphics--not true!  It can only be used on photos, not graphics and it, too, has limitations compared with photo editors included with their competitors (PrintShop, CreataCard, Print Master).   There are many limitations in working with text boxes as well.  If you want a line of text to have one word in one color and another word in different color or font, each word has to be in a separate text box (this is not true with the competitors named above).  I do wonder if they actually let comsumers beta test any of their new products before releasing them--Hallmark has to have heard about all these drawbacks to their program, yet never change them.  I agree with the other reviewer in that that are many duplicate cards from previous versions.  I am also disappointed that many of the graphics included in their clip art are still rather low-end (and not much different from last year's version).   The graphics on their pre-made cards are, for the most part, of excellent quality--much different from the clip art.  I wouldn't waste my money on this version if you already own versions from any of the past several years.  And I definitely wouldn't expect anything in the area of customer service from Hallmark since their reps obviously do not use the product!	2007-01-26

I was amazed when I first saw Dragon in action. It works quickly to capture your words. The one drawback I have found is the training. Despite my having a pretty clear voice, it still fails to capture all of my words accurately even when I have trained it specifically for those words. Since I am a very fast typist, sometimes it is just not worth using it for short documents etc. I can see however, where people who peck at the keyboard would find it very handy. In addition, it really can help cut back on muscle and joint strain from computer work.<br /><br />I have found it to be very useful for writing. By talking to it like you would a friend, words flow smoothly and naturally which can make the process of writing so much easier. Overall this is a neat tool. Recommend!	2012-09-27

Learning of Parallels Desktop, my strategy was to recreate the Windows machine on an underused MacBook Pro. The software was on sale with free shipping so I bought a copy.     My first installation failed on an upgrade notice that popped up while I was entering the activation key. The machine locked up hard but luckily I was a able remove the corrupted install. The second attempt went well after dismissing the upgrade notice. With Parallels running, I subsequently executed the upgrade.    I created a virtual machine for the 'guest' Windows 2000 operating system and installed it and the legacy software from the original distribution media. That process was wrought with glitches and lockups but eventually everything worked. Still, the feel wasn't quite right.      Fortunately I didn't write this review then; a Leopard compatibility release has been issued and this software now provides a performance level very much comparable to what you would expect with a native hardware machine.     I also have a Windows XP virtual machine running.  It installed from a bootable CD with no issues.  It's response is excellent and it actually boots and shuts down faster than my native hardware machines. It's networked with my home WiFi connected Work Group. Email and Internet works properly and even a USB device works through it's Windows installed driver.     I attempted interfacing Bluetooth device but haven't found a way to connect a Parallels serial port to the virtual Com port that OSX creates from the PowerBook Pro hardware.  I'm thinking a USB Bluetooth dongle with Windows installed drivers might work.    Parallels is developing into a slick program and I admire the intellect behind it.  There are still some rough edges present but the Leopard patched version gets good marks and my recommendation.    ---  CHAS	2008-05-04

The biggest problem with Quicken is that it over reaches and tries to be all things to all people and winds up doing nothing very competently.  In fact it can be downright stupid, making nutty mistakes like treating the market value of a rental property as cash in the bank or misconstruing  transfers between banks as income.  It can take hours to set it right.  How irritating when I paid the extra money to deal with stocks and bonds and investments and feel I can't trust anything it does.

I bought this product in order to be able to transfer videos from TIVO onto my MAC, then onto my Droid X.  While the transfer from TIVO to Mac works, primarily because I am pretty sure TIVO had input into that programming, the Toast component of trying to get it onto the smartphone renders the video to be of such poor quality that it isn't worth your time to do it.  And it does take forever to get it transferred into a format that can be read by the Droid X and other smart phones as I've tested that as well.     Although if you have a Mac I am not sure you have another option for getting the TIVO transfer piece, but after that go with Aunsoft Video Convertor for getting it onto your smartphone.  While still a lengthy process to do so, at least the video output is great.	2010-07-31

US	16013665	R2GWP3TW286QTP	B00F9ZQQ8Q	828072263	Roxio Creator NXT 2	Software	4	1	2	Y	N	A good amount of functionality intended for average users.	This software covers almost all media related tasks with a consistent and straightforward interface.  I can think of more powerful versions of most of the tasks, but they each are more expensive and more difficult to learn than this software, and this software produces great results.<br /><br />For most media tasks, a user just wants a task completed without hassle, for example when burning a CD or converting a video.  For other tasks, such a generating a playlist or editing a digital image, a user will want some balance of options vs ease of use.  I am impressed with the result in basically all cases for this software.  I even caught myself using Roxio instead of GIMP (a powerful imaging program I've used for many years) because I just wanted results quickly.  For a solid 90% of my image tasks relating to photographs (cropping or red eye or minor editing), this would be a quick way to get the job done, but if you're interested in something like photoshop, well, this isn't that.  However, a free program like GIMP can handle advanced tasks despite being user unfriendly for most, which would be an easy supplement for Roxio's general ease and functionality.<br /><br />The video editor is simple and effective for adding captions or making minor manipulations to improve video quality or silly effects.  The real help is that this program will simplify putting your videos on your many different devices and media sharing services.  This was dead simple and well organized.  If you share a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  If you like to make montages or otherwise combine or sort a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  It's quite a lot of fun to do with Roxio.<br /><br />I enjoyed the calendar and greeting card publishing software.  The final product looked professional enough that all you would need to start a business is some good photography and a good printer.<br /><br />I never ran into any problems with installation or glitches.  Converting video takes time, but it seemed about the same as with handbrake or other normal conversion or ripping software.<br /><br />In all honesty, this software is probably best for someone who likes modern technology and isn't afraid to use it, but isn't a power user.  For the functionality, it's a good value.	2014-01-05

It allows you to easily correct common problems with digital images. It provides quick fixes for brightness, color correction, focus, and image rotation. You can accept the preset fixes for each of these, or provide more customized control. You can preview, accept or revert from each change.<br />But this is only the beginning of the creative control the program provides. The traditional darkroom tools of dodging (lightening an area) and burning (darkening an area) are available, with a large variety of \\"brushes\\" and intensity. The \\"clone stamp\\" allows scratches and tears to be fixed in older photos that have been scanned. Blur, sponge, and smudge can also be used to remove blemishes or blend an image. The red eye brush is also useful. Image areas can be easily and precisely selected using several tools. Two of my favorites are the \\"magnetic lasso\\" and the \\"magic wand\\". With these it is easy to draw around a face, object, or landscape feature and select it precisely for moving, removing, darkening, or incorporation in to another image. These tools work so well that an object selection that took me several hours with a competing product I was able to complete in only a few minutes with better results. Control of image layers allows you to compose images of several components. For example, begin with a colored gradient background on one layer, add a portrait on another layer, a landscape object, on a third layer, a full moon on the fourth, and artistic text as final layer. These layers can be turned on and off so the resulting image can show any combination of these elements.<br />A gallery of filters and effects allow artistic, textures, blurs, lighting effects, and surprising and useful distortions and 3d effects. Free form painting, custom shapes, image transformations, video capture, blending of multiple images into a single panorama, and a wide variety of import and export tools make this a very powerful and versatile package.<br />These powerful features are surprising easy to use and make this program useful to both the casual and expert user.ery powerful and versatile package.<br />These powerful features are surprising easy to use and make this program useful to both the casual and expert user.	2002-12-22

Problems:  1.  Which new QB product would be the exact same functions.  2.

So, I called QB CSR.  The tech took 1 hr and 20 minutes to find where QB stored itself as a back up file, and then could not set up on operating file location for all of the stored data.  At least the Tech spoke good English, and no additional charge.  This upgrade is now accessible and working - so far.<br />Advice:  ALWAYS Register your software purchases IMMEDIATELY after purchase.  And, be very careful which version or model of any QB software you buy if you are upgrading.  In fact, always go to one of your local QB Experts FIRST to get advice on which version to buy.  Would I buy this again?  Not a valid question - we QB users are a captured market.	2012-07-18

Windows XP is by far the best OS Microsoft has produced besides Windows 2000. I cannot understand some of these reviews I am reading. As a computer technician, I have been repairing computers since the days of DOS 2.  <br /> <br />I have several office computers all running Windows XP. 1 server running Windows 2000, and 7 servers running Linux, and 1 computer running Mac OSX. So I have worked with them all. <br /> <br />People are claiming windows is less secure than other operating systems. Well, that is simply not true. Mac and Linux have just as many security updates as windows does, and in fact, Linux releases more fixes than Microsoft does for windows. A fully updated OS is very secure, and there have been televised hacker challenges to prove it.  <br /> <br />I will give the reviewers this, Microsoft's products cost way too much. That I cannot argue with. <br /> <br />What makes Windows seem more vulnerable than other OS's is simply the fact that it is more widely used than any other OS. Now if Linux for instance had the larger market share, then the hacker, virus and Spyware makers would be targeting it instead of Windows. It is really nothing more than that.  <br /> <br />Windows XP is a resource hog. I will give the reviewers that. So it obviously requires a newer computer to run it.  <br /> <br />Statistics show that a Windows based computer will get attacked within minutes of connecting it to the internet. So obviously the first thing that needs to be done is patch it. If that is ignored, then you will have problems with it very quickly.  <br /> <br />Any problems that people are having I am willing to bet are all related to the fact that the computer was put onto the internet without patching it. <br /> <br />But Linux and Mac need to be patched also, and ignoring them will result in the same problems. It will just take longer for it to happen. And that goes back to what I said about the market share of the OS, and its popularity. When that shifts to a different OS, if it ever does, the same thing will happen to that OS. <br /> <br />So stop blaming the OS. Blame yourself. Lack of knowledge of the dangers of the Internet, and plain laziness are the real cause of the problems. Not the OS. <br /> <br />	2005-11-17

My children love them all. JumpStart 2nd Grade, however, is not intuitive--even for an advanced kid. My son and I could not figure out how in the world to organize the computations in the math \\"ice cave\\". After several \\"guesses\\" we figured it out. Unfortunately the only instruction the game gave us was to use the columns on the left and top. There are no \\"help\\" functions so if you don't get it, you're on your own. And the games themselves aren't very challenging -- it's the figuring out how to play them that offers the most challenge :)  It would be great if they had different levels of play. I still love JumpStart products...I'm just not a big fan of this particular one.	2011-02-05

When I took the agreement, they downloaded too much software which kept working in the background and causing me interminable problems with Windows 8.  I evenytually with the help of both Microsoft and HP reset the system without the Laplink srevice downloads.<br /><br />I had used Laplink in the past, but would never use it again.<br /><br />I can't say for sure, but my feeling was they would use any excuse to say Laplink could not completley make the tarnsfers w/o their service agreemnt and doowloads.

It uses total immersion without any English (this is a good thing).  I own the full length courses for both Russian and German 1 and 2, and while it was no small investment, it was definitely worth it.  The Rosetta Stone software is like the Pimsleur tapes in that it's the best of its kind and you get what you pay for.  I bought this program to try it and passed it on to a friend when I bought my full courses. <br />The \\"powerpac\\" is a good investment if at least two of the languages out of the seven on the disc are ones you want to learn.  If not, you're better off choosing the specific explorer program for your selected language as single language explorer programs are half the price.<br />Again, this is great software but you won't acheive any level of fluency with the abbreviated programs.  But since the larger programs are extremely expensive,  it's a good way to see if you like the system before you take the big plunge and spend the bucks on the full courses.	2004-03-16

Windows 8 is pretty great. Despite all the hate, it's an improvement over 7. It's faster; it's prettier; it has a lot of cool new features. Ok, so it will take you a few days to get used to using Win+F instead of the start menu. And granted, you'll spend more time on the desktop than with those underpowered apps. But trust me, once you're using it, you'll find no reason to go back, because there is none. This is good old Windows in a slightly new package. Once touch-screen monitors fall in price enough, Win 8 will be the bleeding edge of new tech. You'll want to be part of it.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're one of these odious Windows XP  hipsters who &#34;got off the Windows bandwagon&#34; when Vista came out, you are missing out. Every version of the OS is better than the last; what makes you think that a fifteen-year-old piece of software could possibly be superior? Do yourself a favor and get Win 8. Or a Mac, or Ubuntu.

While I'm thrilled it runs as native \\"Carbonized\\" application on Mac OS X, I've run into a few minor glitches: 1) The application help uses Apple's Help Viewer, but the Swedish grammar reference uses QuickHelp, which crashes often and won't print.  2) The cool Speech Correctness feature works with my PowerBook G4's built-in microphone, but doesn't work correctly with my higher quality iSight microphone.  3) The user interface looks horribly outdated when running in Mac OS X's Aqua interface.<br />That said, this is the best language software I've seen on a computer.  Yes, it includes canned quizzes and games, vocabulary and grammar tutorials, just as you'd expect from educational computer software.  However, its primary teaching mode is non-structured and passive, as an interactive digital textbook. It took me a while to understand this. You can read the titles in any order and have it speak any word or phrase.  Using your computer's microphone, you can record your voice and compare it against the native speaker's. But it can also analyze your voice based on pitch, frictive, and vowel sounds (to varying degrees of success, but enough to make it useful). So, the usage is completely open-ended (what they call the \\"Successful Immersion Approach\\").  In a way, this is better than human instruction.  I sat there trying to nail the pronunciation of a phrase, repeating it over and over, and I thought: a human would never be so patient!  The reward comes not from flashing \\"congratulations, you passed this quiz!\\" at your face, but from within yourself as you experience the joy of entering a foreign language with software \\"training wheels.\\"<br />The technical problems on the Mac version, while frustrating, are not severe enough to prevent usability.<br />You have to have self-discipline to get much out of this software. If you're willing to be your own teacher, it provides a deep and individualized medium for learning a new language. However - if you're in a hurry, I recommend the excellent Pimsleur language series (audio CDs) instead. And if you're looking for comprehensive traditional instruction, I'd recommended a book and CD series called \\"På svenska!\\", ISBN 91-7434-429-3 (not available on Amazon.com).cher, it provides a deep and individualized medium for learning a new language.

After restarting, uninstalling and reinstalling cyberlink, nothing improved. The programs then refused to see ASIO again...then I loaded my video files from a DVD, just to see what would happen.

I finally understood that he said there was no way it would install with anything but an older version of DW or GoLive.  When I started to complain that one of his cohorts told me that it would install with Photoshop CS5 already installed, he hung up on me.

My subscription for 2006 was up and I needed to renew - since I just reinstalled Windows XP Professional (SP2) on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 9300, Intel Pentium M 2GHz, 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Disk), I decided to simply purchase the 360.    I have been having issues with the Live Update for several weeks now (Error 5).  Instead I have to download a 15 MB file ever so often with the updated definitions.    After checking the technical support website, it appears that Norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it.  That was just about two weeks ago.  Customer support is non-existent it appears since I have yet to be contacted.    Complete waste of time.  Renew your existing subscriptions instead.  I wish that I had.    2007-06-22: Just to update what I said earlier - I am now being prompted every day to reinstall the product.  Even after I did it.  There were no problems during installation or anything.  Really annoying.  And if I don't do it, I am not protected by any threats.  So I need to use my other computers to do online transactions.  Ridiculous.  I'd give it 0 stars.	2007-04-15

She said when I have a chance to make her a copy.  Usually I get back home and forget to do so.  When I remember, it takes time to locate the recipe, make a copy, and then drop it in the mail or remember to take it along the next time we meet.  Not being very savvy with my electronics, I was amazed at how easy it was to pull out my I-phone, pull up the recipe, and e-mail it to her - all while I was sitting in her chair.<br />Looking at being a snow bird in Arizona next year.

If you have never used Quickbooks before,  give the Mac version a try for your business.  If your company deals with a single currency, is service-oriented, or if product-oriented has simple inventory needs, Quickbooks for Mac 2013 could fit your needs well.<br /><br />My wife and I still use Quickbooks for Windows on our Macs for about a dozen companies by running the Windows version under [[ASIN:B008YTAKJA Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac]].  But, for several of these companies, Quickbooks for Mac is now a viable option.  It still lacks the full feature sets of [[ASIN:B008S0IWNQ QuickBooks Pro 2013 [Download]]], much less [[ASIN:B008S0J1G8 QuickBooks Accountant 2013 [Download]]], which is why most of the companies we work with will stay on the Windows version for now in spite of the additional complexity of running Parallels Desktop on our Macs.<br /><br />Quickbooks for Mac 2013 permits batch invoicing (perfect for homeowner's associations and businesses that bill a group of clients a similar amount), payments via Intuit Payment Network (no monthly fee e-checks and credit card payments), and the ability to attach documents to transactions.  It supports up to 5 users on the same local network working in one company file at the same time (per-user licenses required), with user-permissions that limit what each person can see and do.  Since 2012, it has supported progress or phased invoices, useful for contractors and architects, for example.<br /><br />QBMac still uses the floating window paradigm, one which Apple, Adobe and others are moving away from for Mac applications  (e.g., Aperture, Final Cut, iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, Dreamweaver), but it remembers the last location and size of each window, so you can create a working layout of activity windows that suits your needs - you'll just see whatever other application windows are behind these as with all old-style Mac apps.<br /><br />The new Guide Me window automatically changes its content to reflect help and guidance for whatever you are doing, however many of the videos simply display \\"Work in Progress\\" when you click on them.  Some of those that do work have muddy sound and are compressed so much that you cannot read the screen text.<br /><br />A personal thing due to my age:  Most program text in QBMac is quite small on my 27\\" Apple LED Cinema display which, as with most Apple laptops, has a higher pixels-per-inch PPI than older monitors.  I'd like to see Intuit give us the option of changing the type size, the size of which strains my aging eyes, even with special computer glasses.  It is the tiniest text of any program I work with.  (Palette text in some other programs is the same size - but not functional dialogs/windows.  My workaround is to drag QBMac onto an old secondary monitor that is 72 ppi.)  An exception to this is the left-column list of customer:jobs, vendors, etc in the Invoice, Enter Bills etc windows - this is extremely readable for me.  Registers, not so much.  I don't need any of Apple's 'Universal Access' features for anything else on my Mac, so adding 'zoom' or changing from non-native screen resolution just for QBMac is not something I'm willing to consider.<br /><br />For the few companies I have that would work with the feature set of Quickbooks for Mac, there are still small things that will keep me on the Windows version... but only because it's already running on my Mac.  If I wasn't already set up with Quickbooks for Windows, I might force myself to live with these issues in Quickbooks for Mac:<br /><br />1.  Consultants, attorneys, accountants, architects, graphics artists, etc. often like to record their time while the work is actually being done.  The QBWin Enter Single Activity window has a timer built-in.  It's so easy to start the timer and add additional notes as you work on a task.  If the phone rings, or you have to work on another task for a while, just stop that activity, to be returned to later, and start a new one for the phone call.  Etc.  When you return to an earlier activity, just start the timer again to continue on, adding additional notes and obtaining a total time entry for that one task which can later be transferred, with the notes (optional), as a single line to an invoice.  With QBMac, there is no built-in timer.  Instead, you must download the separate My Time application via the Customers > Time Tracking > Download My Time menu, and remember to refresh its lists every time you add or edit a customer:job or billable item (no dynamic linking to your company data).  My Time saves a separate time entry each time you pause it.  These entries can be merged when you export back into QBMac, but not with the same per-activity result as QBWin if you continue to add additional notes for what is intended as a single billable entry.  In general, I find having to launch a separate app (My Time) that requires management and export to keep the company file up to date an unnecessary additional level of complexity over time tracking within QBWin.  QBMac just needs to add a timer button to their Single Activity window, as has been requested for many years.<br /><br />2.  QBMac now allows very long Notes fields for time and invoice entries, and thus is able to import that data from a QBWin file without data loss.  (QBMac 2010, e.g., truncated all imported notes and did not allow data entry of long notes.)  However, none of those fields expands to show the data or displays a scroll bar.  For example, in an invoice, only a single line is displayed - making it nearly impossible to edit a multi-line note.  You can only see the multiple lines if you switch to preview mode - but you cannot edit there.  (This contrasts with the Windows version which wraps the notes in the invoice, giving a live, editable preview.)<br /><br />3.  QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.  For QBWin users, GoPayment is free of fees other than transaction fees.<br /><br />4.  QBMac still only works with Intuit's online payroll, which starts at $25/month.  This $300 per year compares to the street price of about $50/year for the basic 3-employee payroll for QBWin.  One company we have has a single part-time employee with under $4,000/year in wages.  The $300/year Intuit fee is just unreasonable for us.<br /><br />5.  Column width cannot be changed in forms (Bills, Invoices, General Journal, etc) - and thus complete data cannot be read.  For example, if you have nested subaccounts, you'll have no idea what the actual account is by viewing one of these forms unless you click on the account control. Ditto customer:job if the customer name is long.  Dynamic column resizing (and remembering user preferences) is essential (and works in the Windows version).<br /><br />Conversion of QBWin files to QBMac format improves each year, for those who are either migrating, or need to send their file back and forth to a bookkeeper or accountant on the other platform.  As always, it is important to know what things do convert and which things do not.  QBMac does not have a means of importing accountant changes or journal entries, and so if a file is sent to an accountant, the QBMac user must not do anything in their copy of the file until they receive the file back from the accountant/bookkeeper.  (This differs from the abilities of QBWin.)<br /><br />Bottom line:  Quickbooks for Mac 2013 is a solid release that can address the bookkeeping needs of many types of small businesses.  Intuit offers a free trial, and I encourage you to download it to see if your business needs are met by the product.  For myself, as a Quickbooks for Windows user who wants to switch, Intuit needs to resolve the issues in this review before I would migrate.  Naturally, I also look forward to the day that the Mac product achieves feature-parity with the Windows product so that we can completely leave Windows behind.QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.

What is very apparent is that they don't pay attention to detail and consistency of operation.  One dialog box appears to allow you to edit reverse transitions but that option is ghosted so it isn't available.  Transition times will jump from 29 seconds to the next full minute.

This does not give you a chance to truly evaluated the additions before they demand that you pay for them.<br /><br />The secret to this package is to ONLY load the main program to start with and then go back and load the add-on AFTER you understand what you have paid for and what it can do.	2012-04-11

There are some nice synth and other samples. I will probably end up using some of it somewhere. <br /> <br />However, I bought it hoping for a slew of drum loops. I use drum loops in my recordings for all my drum tracks. <br /> <br />This DVD was disappointing in that respect. It has a number of loops, but they do not support ACID - in other words, if the loop was played at 100 beats per minute (BPM), and you drag it into a song (like in Cakewalk Guitar Tracks Pro) that is set to play at 120 BPM, the drums will still play at 100 BMP and won't sync to your song. <br /> <br />There are ways to stretch the loops, but it's not automatic like ACIDized loops (e.g. SmartLoops, BetaMonkey). <br /> <br />And, if you can find loops that are at the tempo you want (again, there are a lot of loops and fairly well organized too), the problem is that there may be only 10 loops that match with respect to the drum kit used in the loop (whether real or electronic), recording (some have reverb, echo, etc., others don't), etc.  <br /> <br />You might get a few straight beats, some with a ride cymbal, and a few fills, but I didn't find enough different loops of any one drum kit or recording session to create much of a song with. I like the BetaMonkey CD's where you might have 20 different slightly varied basic grooves (e.g. an extra kick or snare hit, different dynamics, etc.), another 20 or so where a ride cymbal is added, maybe 10 2-measure fills, another 10 4-measure fills, some tempo retard or increase loops, etc., all done at the same recording session with the same kit. <br /> <br />Since my needs were mainly for drum loops, this DVD didn't really meet my expectations. If you're looking for a lot of different samples of different things, you might find them here.	2006-03-02

It was pretty intuitive: you load clips from your camcorder via the firewire and then drag them onto the story line and edit them, crop them, and pick transitions.  I haven't tried anything more fancy than that.  For my basic needs, this is perfect - and it appears to be extensible with plugins, if I decide that I need more at some point.	2003-08-11

Since this is the only antivirus program I use on my laptop, I have nothing to compare it to as far as virus-tracking efficiency is concern.

Yes, you heard me correctly: it retards access to the net via Internet Explorer.<br /><br />This was not too much of a problem for me since I prefer Firefox anyway, but the amount problems that have occurred from the moment it was first installed is enough to give Microsoft [...] envy. I had to uninstall/reinstall the software numerous times off the CD. When it just would not install properly (certain features caused the program to crash), I contacted customer support. They emailed me a link to download an updated version of the installer file and it finally installed properly.<br /><br />Since then, I noticed that my computer started lagging seriously. My freshly-formatted 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo w/ 1 GB of RAM began lagging seriously. I hit Alt + Ctrl + Del to see how my system resources were allocated and which programs were hogging my CPU and RAM. Somehow, Trend Micro is completely draining a good chunk of my RAM and has slowed my computer to a crawl.

If I did not already need Premier, I would be very upset and believe the backlash from consumers as documented in the comments and rankings here has been appropriate. I have used TurboTax since the &#34;dial up&#34; days, but am really disappointed in this latest development.  I may consider switching next year just to see what other options look like. Speaking of options, after I heard about the disappointed Deluxe users, I started researching what other options existed.  Based on a quick internet search, it appears H&R Block's software allows you to import last year's data directly from TurboTax, so the switch may be less painful than I would have initially expected.<br />I wonder why TurboTax would not have done their research as to what their competitors are offering?  If they did their research, did they really think that people would stay loyal in spite of facing reduced functionality in their software?  Did they think that users that were not directly affected by the change wouldn't notice and wonder if their version was next?  If so, they were wrong......	2015-01-25

I bought this program because I`ve been wanting to re-learn Spanish again and this looked like a good beginners course for any age. I've tried 2 other Spanish programs and had no luck. They were too complicated and frustrating and I gave up.    With Discover Spanish I was able to immediately start learning the basics in an easy to understand and colorful format. The lessons are nice & short (about 10-15 minutes) and I don't feel overwhelmed or confused. They are broken up into small bites that are easy to digest. Sometimes I did one lesson at a time and other days I was able to do 2 or 3 in a row. As easy as it appears to be, though, I found it was best to not rush ahead too quickly because I needed that retention time, to let what I learned, really sink in. I could practice the conversations by repeatedly clicking on the animated characters as needed and hearing them repeat the sentence as many times as I needed, then go on to the next when I was ready. Using \\"flash\\" is a terrific interactive feature of the program and allows this back and forth interaction. I don't know of any other Spanish programs that have this design feature.(and I've been looking!) I'm a visual person so this  program has been a blessing for me! It took me awhile before I figured out who was who with all the characters, but after you get into the lessons, you see that Johnny and Cristina are brother and sister, Miquel is Cristina's husband, Silvia is a neighbor, and so on. Reviewing grammar and pronunciation was effortless and easy. Another nice feature is the games and cultural notes at the end of each lesson. My favorite lesson is learning different objects in a room. It has a fly that buzzes around the room and lands on different items that you say in Spanish. You click on whatever item you want and that's where the fly goes to. The lessons are well thought out and all build upon each other.     I was very impressed with the amount of learning I was able to accomplish in a few short weeks!These guys really have defined the word E A S Y. My only complaint, if I had to find one, is that there isn't a Discover Spanish CDROM #2, so that I can continue. This program is well worth the modest price I paid- in fact I see it as a real bargain. It is well deserving of the 5 star rating I'm giving it! If you really want to learn how to speak Spanish with little effort, I highly recommend this one!	2009-01-15

This is basically a collection of tactics problems, which vary from straightforward to quite challenging, organized by themes - annihilation of defence, distraction, space clearance, Xray attack, etc. My rating is about 1600 and I consider myself a better tactical than strategic player (this program rates my ELO on these tactical problems over 2000), yet I still find many of the problems quite challenging. If you start to solve the problem incorrectly, the program gives you an easier problem with a similar theme before returning to the original problem. If you still don't get the original more complex problem, it will cue you with the proper piece to start the combination though not the exact move. It also rates your play on each problem and estimates your overall ELO rating. Modes include learning exercises, tests, and actual play against the computer starting from the problem position. Overall this program is really great; in fact it's so much fun you really don't want to stop. I don't have earlier versions of this software for comparison, but the immediate visualization of seeing the pieces play out the combination sure beats sitting with tactics problem books.    I do agree with other reviewers that the installation is confusing; I was getting annoyed at my apparent failure to install when I discovered it had in fact already installed, just made me think it hadn't.    Also one small criticism - After you make the initial move or two, some of the problems have variations, and the computer sometimes plays these out quicker than my eye/brain can follow and I haven't figured out how to slow it down.    Still on the balance, this is an enjoyable program that will help you find the right combination when you know it's there somewhere, and sometimes even when you didn't think there could possibly be anything there!	2010-08-17

It had the a similar NOLO set of forms four many varied small business uses.  There's a little more to this, but ultimately it's not a comforting interface and does not give me confidence that I would want from a business tool. Quicken seems to have lost their way over the years when it comes to ease of use.  They made their name when filling in a check like form you could organize your expenses.  Something most people could understand and you would be able to go from there.<br /><br />Why not come up with and interface that would extract most personal data from one form set entry and you could select one or more entities from there to fill the forms once you wanted to get going.  I thought there was more relevant info in that book I reviewed than I can glean from this software, so if I paid 50 bucks for this I'd feel cheated. Strangely enough, inside the box is a small pocketbook by NOLO. What I found that was strange is this had a number of topics covered, only a few of which were for businesses.  Instead tips on family planning, weddings, career and other general topics. Does not his package say on the outside it's intended for Legal Business, contracts and forms?<br /><br />Maybe it's a good idea to package a number of NOLO books into one package, but I'd rather they tell me that, then putting together something that seemed like it could have been focused and useful and turned up nearly useless.

It works well with Microsoft Word and Converts Word to PDF flawlessly.

Although it's well known Symantec makes reliable softwares, When we talk about their rebates, they are liars. Yes, liars ¨Cthey really deserve this. Based on my personal experience, I even think theirs are worse than the notorious I/O Magic's (aka, Hi-Val, Digital research). I bought several Norton softwares during last December, and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items, Guess what, until today I got only one of them, and it has been almost 6 months. I guess they are testing my memory but unfortunately I kept a good record of every rebate I submitted. That's what we should do if we are going to buy Symantec softwares with rebates involved, although the best thing I would recommend is to avoid as long as you can.	2003-05-16

With a collection of more than 10,000 LPs, I have since purchased their SoundSoap and SuperFreq plugins, and used them to digitize more than 500 LPs.  For the casual user or those with just a handful of albums to digitize, there are easier and cheaper (some free) methods.  While I would judge the learning-curve to effectively use Peak and its plug-ins to be moderately significant, discriminating users will benefit from the broad flexibility and quality provided by the sound processing software made by Bias.    A few additional notes for making superior digital copies from your analog (LP) sources:  1.  Start with a quality playback front-end; turntable, stylus, electronics.  2.  I bypass my Mac's sound card in favor of using quality, out-board D/A and A/D processors for recording and playback.  3.  Thoroughly clean your LPs before digitizing them.  I use a VPI wet-vacuum record cleaner.  4.  Use post-processing software (SoundSoap & SuperFreq) judiciously and conservatively.	2010-08-12

They sold to Corel.<br />I agreed with most people that going with Corel was not something I was willing to tolerate; I would not use Corel if it were free.<br />Most reviewers said not to buy the Sony because it was too much learning curve.<br /><br />What I like about the Sony package is; although the learning curve may be a little more steep, the understanding curve is right on. It makes sense and it works.<br />It works.<br />It works.<br />I also tried the Adobe Premiere package and was more disappointed with that than I have ever been with a software package; crash city, the one thing I could rely on when I booted the software is it was going to lock up.<br /><br />Sony Works.<br />It does not try to make all the decisions for you, it does not try to assume it knows more about what you want than you; you make the decisions and give the commands then the software works for you; it works.<br /><br />I also like the idea of the separate programs for the different aspects of production.<br />A video editor program.<br />An audio program.<br />A music production program.<br />A disc authoring program.<br /><br />Each program does its thing;<br />and it works.<br /><br />I would recommend this package to anyone wanting to get above the click it and settle for it video editing but don't have a ton of money to throw away.<br /><br />I am happy; it works.	2014-03-31

I have a copy of Elements 3 that I used to use for my XP laptop, where it worked like a charm, despite lacking some of the more customizable filters of the real thing. When I got my new Windows 7 64-bit tower, I was disappointed that, while Elements 3 would run, there were some interface screws. While the actual edits turned out perfectly, there were two annoyances: 1) most edits would cause the picture to glitch out until you changed the zoom factor of the window; and 2) the cursor appears offset to where you actually click. It was these inconveniences that made me want to trade up for a Windows 7-compatible version, and when I saw there was a trial version of Elements 10 on Adobe's site, I had to give it a whirl.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much to write home about. The filter libraries are basically the same, and there didn't appear to be any new tools. The changes amounted to about half a dozen background programs trying to get me online, asking at multiple stages for my Adobe username (which I only really have for one college course, and don't see any other need for). For some reason the cursor was changing to the loading icon every few seconds, and the program was running much more slowly than Elements 3 (I have 6GB RAM, and I'm surprised the program wants more memory for the same tasks). Finally, the interface is just annoying to look at - within five minutes my eyes felt sore from trying to read tiny light gray text on a dark grey background - a far cry from Adobe's tried-and-true black on white.  I uninstalled it after about an hour. After giving it a try, I could learn to love Elements 3's quirks on my new system.	2011-10-27

My old unit was hardware only and actually cost more!  I used my regular video editing software to capture, edit and burn.  For those of you who may not already have other software, this product includes that as well.  Nice.  I just use the advanced mode though to capture the raw footage and then import into my video editing software which I am already familiar with to do the rest so I haven't played with the editing and/or burning features here.  I did capture 1 hour of VHS footage though with no dropped frames so I am very pleased.  I also like the feature/option of capturing longer length footage to fit on a DVD by lowering the quality.  Since VHS quality is already lacking though, I think I would opt for full quality captures in chunks if necessary.  I recommend this product for VHS to digital conversion.	2013-06-14

I am a new Mac user so I spent some time researching two different products for my banking needs. I am a LONG time Quicken for PC user and my first choice was to stick with Quicken. I read many reviews and became leery of the Mac version so I did some research on ibank. I decided to buy it and got it installed. That's where the experience went south.<br />I, like others have reported, had a terrible time trying to set up my accounts. I only use checking and savings registers so I expected it to go fairly easy. Went thru the tutorials and still had problems. Went to their support site and no customer support phone number. Chat was offered but my hours don't fit with an east coast based center.<br />Then, while on the site I saw the announcement that they were releasing ibank 5. I had just purchased ibank 4 the day before. They stated they would offer a free upgrade to customers who had purchased from their site or Amazon but not the app store. I contacted CS to ask about this and they pretty much blew me off. That solved it for me right there. A company that makes it hard to get support and then a policy that doesn't take care of their customers is one I won't deal with.<br />I contacted Apple support and explained the situation and my dis-satisfaction and requested a refund. I was given the refund no questions asked. I then went back and did more research on Quicken Essentials and decided to buy. It installed easily and my accounts converted seamlessly. Setting up my bank worked perfectly and the download was successful. And all my scheduled transactions came over so I don't have to set them all up again.<br />Others have reported Quicken doesn't have tax reporting; I found a tax schedule report right on their main account page. Summarized all my transactions based on the categories I have set up.<br />I am not experiencing any of the issues others have posted and it feels really close to Quicken for PC. I recommend Quicken for Mac over ibank especially if you don't need all the investment tracking features. And, to ice the cake, I found a $10.00 off coupon I was able to use that brought the cost down to $39.99. Very pleased with the product.	2013-11-07

(See [...] for detailed descriptions of changes.)<br /><br />But I do like the improvements in the ribbon: firstly, you can hide it, to get more usable screen; secondly, you can customize it!  Both of these were missing features in Office 2007, desired by many (if not most) users.<br /><br />There are also some security improvements that are useful: e.g., Word opens downloaded files in a protected mode; PowerPoint allows presentations to be restricted from editing/copying.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between this version and a previous one, definitely I'd recommend this one.  If you're trying to decide whether to pay for an upgrade, it depends on how irritated you get with the limitations of the ribbon in the 2007 version.<br /><br />For users in a business setting, some of the collaboration features (using Sharepoint Server) might also be of interest.  See link above for more info.	2010-11-28

In my situation I was required to file IRS form 8959 to recover over-witholding of Medicare taxes by my employer.  This is handled by Part V of the form, which has calculated fields only, derived from inputs elsewhere in the return.  The calculations were not performed by the Block software and any attempt to override them would have resulted in an inability to file electronically which I have done for over 15 years.  So I engaged with H&R Block via customer service over a period of more than 3 weeks.  I found H&R Block service representatives to be helpful both via chat and on the phone.  The problem was that, in spite of the issue being raised through three tiers of support and ultimately to the developers, at no time did H&R Block acknowledge the defect and therefore would not fix it.  So they ultimately agreed to refund the purchase price (I trust it will arrive soon).  With no other alternative, I returned to Turbotax which by now has offered customers forced to upgrade, a rebate (just for this year) to cover the incremental cost.  As expected, Turbotax did handle my situation correctly, saving me about $275 far more than the cost of the software.	2015-04-01

I just received Fluenz Spanish last week and started on Level 1.  I am very, very impressed with the Fluenz method and also how easy it was to download all five levels to my computer.  I tried Rosetta Stone and it was a nightmare getting the software to work properly and with Rosetta Stone, I often had to guess at what I was supposed to do.  I think it is great that Fluenz has a tutor at the beginning and end of each session and she explains things very well and is very motivating.  This is the perfect language learning program for adult English speakers. When you are going through the lessons and you type in the incorrect answer, you hear a swishing sound and you can't advance to the next workout but if you can't figure out what you did wrong, you can click on the ANSWER button and it will tell you the correct answer and then you can correct your answer and move on. I feel like I have learned more in two sessions of Fluenz than I did in twenty sessions of Rosetta Stone. Please don't waste your money on Rosetta Stone.  The customer support was terrible and the method is not the best for adult learners.  The customer and tech support at Fluenz is excellent.    If you can't afford private lessons, Fluenz is the program for you.  It is easy to download the lessons to your IPad when you are on the go.  I wish everyone at Fluenz much success and hope this company is around for years to come.  It is the best foreign language program around.  GO FLUENZ!!!	2015-05-21

It is never easy to do. When you first import photos into the program's \\"well\\" they are large enough to see what's in them. When you go to the next stage (the \\"create\\" stage) -- where you can sort and re-arrange the slides -- the photos are way too small and you can't enlarge them. Also, I create title pages in Photoshop and import them, and in the \\"create\\" stage, you can't make out the words to figure out where to place them. Also, I have prepared complete slide shows and gotten to the point where I was previewing them (as happened today) and the program would freeze, and I lost hours of work. Not good! Now we know why Adobe has stopped selling the program and is just providing a simple version for free.	2007-07-08

I have to agree with the other review about the difficulties to install Project 2000. In fact at my office we've yet to have it completely set up to my entire satisfaction.<br /> However I would not give it two stars. I'd rate it three starts, because of the following:<br /> ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:<br /> -It allows for a very nice way to keep track of projects on a distributed environment, such as we have back at the office, where two developers (for example) work from their homes in distant cities. Project Central, the feature Project 2000 includes, which allows for a web-based project management interface is definitely the largest plus it comes bundled with.<br /> ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE:<br /> -The way to update the original Project files by means of the web-based update is very convoluted for the project manager: it generates one individual update per project where the person reporting back is working on, which can be very cumbersome if the person works in several (3-4) activities at the same time.<br /> -There is no way to make comments about the progress of each of the specific activities, in the form of a log, or something similar. So, an update from a person working on a project has to be coupled with a status report, which is not exactly what you'd call one of the best implemented features of Project.<br /> However, overall, I HAVE to acknowledge that it has helped me as Project Manager to have a better tracking of projects occurring left and right.	2001-06-21

It's easy for those who are used to the levels of complexity involved with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to proclaim them to be superior to any and all other similar products. However, for those who are not as tech savvy as your more current webcomic artists, graphic designers, or other aspiring digital artists, there comes another product that is far more approachable than the Adobe line of products, yet still has the potential to equal the power of the likes of Illustrator.<br /><br />Corel products, in the past, have been very hit or miss. Sometimes you would be landed with a solid piece of software; other times you were left in an anticlimactic state of disdain over what was nothing more than a lackluster piling of clunky and poorly thought out features. X5 has managed to avoid this, focusing on everything from a better system of color management (proper grayscaling is now a possibility) to something that easily rivals a program I've fought with many times in the past; Adobe Bridge.<br /><br />Indeed, Corel Connect is possibly the best new feature. While it lacks much of the customization that was permitted with coding in Adobe Bridge, Corel Connect has simplified the process. Often, the computer layman would beat on his or her keys in frustration trying to use Bridge, whereas Connect offers much the same end result on a simplified scale, allowing the quick transfer from CorelDraw to Photo-Paint (Corel's PhotoShop equivalent) simply and without extensive knowledge of file formats and coding.<br /><br />Resizing and reshaping images in previous versions of CorelDraw was never fun, and the constant warping and unwanted glitches that would occur (especially when rounding the corners of rectangles) made the prospect of toying with any images not an option if you wanted to conserve your image. Colors, too, have gained an enormous degree of flexibility; the ability to play with shades and brightness has gone from overly simplistic to being simple to do, but with all the depth you would ever expect out of Illustrator.<br /><br />The problems converting PNG are also gone and exporting to older formats in CorelDraw is now an actual option. It seems with this iteration, a lot of work was put into something that should be an obvious option.<br /><br />But just scratching the surface of their big features, CorelDraw has started to catch up with Illustrator; newer brushes, better docking options, photo effects, tool tips that actually make sense, streamlined and logical hot keys, and image sprayer options that are absolutely delightful. CorelDraw is starting to come into its own, and one can only hope that future releases continue to refine a product that has long been sitting on the sideline watching Adobe take all the glory.<br /><br />If you're looking for something without the learning curve of Illustrator and others, stop at CorelDraw. They might be finally finding their way.<br /><br />~*~ct out of Illustrator.  The problems converting PNG are also gone and exporting to older formats in CorelDraw is now an actual option.

But I'm here to advocate a different approach to diagramming.  With the release of Office XP, Microsoft has made PowerPoint so intuitive, precise and powerful that - for the vast majority of us - Visio is overkill.<br />I do lots of business flow-like diagrams.  I've worked with Visio in the past, but I feel like the following method works far better for me:<br />1) Start by building a rudimentary version of what you want in PowerPoint.  True, PowerPoint doesn't give you the snap-and-lock type features that are at the core of Visio...but you can closely approximate it with various easy-to-learn techniques.  The best thing about PowerPoint is that every action is completely intuitive.  I've been able to build some pretty complex things without once looking at online help.<br />2) Now, once your rudimentary version is in place, you can go back through and punch things up with appropriate graphics.  Microsoft provides a great online tool for this purpose called &quot;Design Gallery Live.&quot;  You have access to it as part of your Office XP purchase.  Say that at a certain place, your diagram calls for a picture of a CPU.  Bring up Design Gallery Live through the &quot;Clips Online&quot; option of PowerPoint and put 'CPU' in as the search term and, voila, there are four pages of images for you to choose from.<br />3) You can go beyond Design Gallery Live with the help of Google.  Their (relatively) new Image search feature is a boon for anyone putting together a presentation.  The other day, I needed a generic image of an ATM.  I put &quot;Automated Teller Machine&quot; in as a search term for a Google Image search and got nine pages of images back.<br />4) Back in PowerPoint, once you drop these images into place, you can double-click on them &amp; go to the 'Size' panel of the 'Format Picture' dialogue box.  Play with Height &amp; Width parameters to get to proper scaling for each of the images you've selected (keep the ratios equal, though).<br />5) You can use the various 'Alignment' options (available through the Drawing menu at the left-hand corner of your screen) to line up the various objects as you see appropriate.<br />I suggest you give this approach a try as well before committing extra money to buy Visio.  You'll be surprised at how powerful Powerpoint has become &amp; how you can assemble professional, eye-catching presentations in a very short period of time.os equal, though).<br />5) You can use the various 'Alignment' options (available through the Drawing menu at the left-hand corner of your screen) to line up the various objects as you see appropriate.  <br />I suggest you give this approach a try as well before committing extra money to buy Visio.

You can't read the maps, maps are only for a few cities, and the interface is less than user friendly.  I finally went with Earthcomber, but when that didn't have directions (just the map and POI, but its all free) I got Mapopolis, which is wonderful.  If you want Directions on the Go, rethink it, I suggest Mapopolis.

A friend who is an IT person with over 10 years working on computers spent 6 plus hours trying to get it networked to my other 3 XP computers and failed to get it to talk to them or even see them. His suggestion was to upgraded my $2000 HP laptop to Windows 7. I checked this laptop with Windows 7 Upgrade advisor and it said that with the exception of two programs the laptop was up gradable to Windows 7. After buying Windows 7 Pro from Amazon and loading it on the laptop the sound would not work. A check with HP said that this laptop was not compatible with windows 7 and there are no drivers for it. After 10 days and buying a USB sound device for the laptop to get the sound to function the display stopped working except in safe mode. Now the desk top has developed a problem that when a program is started (makes no difference what program) and then is exited, you have to logoff then back on to get another program or even the one that was exited to start. I have since removed 7 from both computers and reinstalled XP. Both computers now function just fine and see each other and talk to each other on the network.. When Microsoft stops supporting XP, I'll replace my computers with a MAC. Windows 7 was a waste of over $400 for me.	2010-10-20

But, at some point you really do have to crack a book, conjugate a few verbs, and study...	The Rosetta Stone line of language products all share the same basic design and interface. The key to the Rosetta Stone system is the presentation of word and action associations, influenced by context. This simulates the sort of cues that one would parse and process in speaking any language, even your own native language. Normally, you don't think about this as you speak your own language. But it's one of the hardest things to simulate outside of dealing with a second language in its own country and having the chance to deal with real life situations involving speakers of the second language.<br /><br />Each screen is accompanied by a phrase, spoken out loud by a native speaker in the program, and four slightly different picture scenes that require you to pick the one that the sentence is referring to. Beginning at a very basic level -- such as \\"the boy is under the tree\\" (in whatever language) with four pictures of a boy next to, under, in the limbs of and cutting down the tree --  your proficiency improves as you move through these basic cues to more advanced and complex speaking and contexts. By the end of the program you are dealing with fairly complex situations, sentences and associations.<br /><br />The program also allows you to repeat the phrase and, using the supplied microphone, match and score your own pronunciation against the supplied sample. You can also test your ability to properly write out a second language by spelling out and typing the phrase, although the work arounds for using a US English QWERTY keyboard with the special characters and distinct keyboard layouts used by different languages can be awkward. There are several variations on all the visual, verbal and textual tests.<br /><br />The most important question one must answer when considering this product is: will it, as the advertising suggests, be a magic gateway to language learning that is all you need? The answers is: sort of.<br /><br />First, this is an expensive product. Make no mistake, when you pay for a heavily advertised product like this that you are, in part, paying the cost of the extensive advertising that brought it to your attention and put you in a mind to buy it.<br /><br />Second, although Rosetta Stone is an extremely well thought out and useful system for review, practice, improving reaction times to prompts in other languages, and gaining fluency through exposure to variable contexts, it is not a complete language course.<br /><br />I have purchased a load of different language courses for languages that I have wanted to study on my own, and I can say, at least for me, that using at least two or more different packages that compliment, reinforce and overlap with each other is always better than trying to learn everything with only the logic and pattern of one single course. Besides, you really do need to learn grammar and other parts of the subject that cannot really be covered by, or communicated well by, a single program, even one as well thought out as Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />At some point you really do have to crack a book, even though Rosetta Stone strongly implies that you can be speaking away in a second language with nothing more than some time in front of your laptop.<br /><br />Conclusion: whatever language you are wanting to study, seriously consider Rosetta Stone. But also seriously consider buying a Pimsleur and a Living Language course to go along with it, and seriously contemplate the very un-Rosetta Stone-ish subject of studying verb conjugation rules, grammar, usage and verb tables.<br /><br />All together you will stand a much better chance of gaining real fluency, and not just the ability to distinguish if the boy is in, under or besides he tree, or if all of the people, two of the people, the two men or the three women in the picture are eating steak or drinking wine.

I never used any of the budgeting features because I don't need a pie chart to tell me not to spend more money than I make!<br /><br />I reluctantly made the switch to Quicken starter edition last year and figured it would be easy since to learn I was already using QuickBooks at work.  Well it was a rocky & frustrating conversion but I learned to live with it.  I took the opportunity to upgrade to Quicken Premier 2013 when I was offered a trial through Amazon Vine.  I was actually pleased at the seamless import of my existing file.  I had no problems whatsoever in that regard.  Quicken Premier claims it tracks investments, unlike the starter edition, but it didn't work for me.  I was disappointed to find that I still cannot get my IRA account data to download.<br /><br />Quicken Premier 2013 seems to freeze up less on my system but other than that I honestly can't notice much difference between the Premier and Starter versions-- for the things I use it for anyway. Unless you are having issues with the version you have, I wouldn't rush to upgrade.  If you are using financial software for the first time, make sure you really need all the features of this program because otherwise you're going to spend a lot of time getting it all set up vs. what you're going to gain from it.  If you're looking to manage your investment portfolio- I hope you have better luck getting that function to work than I did.	2012-11-26

I held off upgrading for last 4 versions because they were buggy and Intuit has been disabling or removing core features that I use frequently. I was aware of the flap over the elimination of the QIF format, but since I don't download data from financial institutions I thought I could live with the new QFX format.  Wrong.  Quicken 2006 imports to checking, savings, and credit card accunts (the most important accounts) ONLY in the new format, but has NO ability to export in the new format.  This makes it impossible to transfer account data from one Quicken database to another, or to rebuild accounts if the your database file gets corrupted.  After four years killing off QIF you'd think they would be able to export in the new format or provide the means to transfer between databases, a capability Quicken has had since the DOS days. <br /> <br />Other long time Quicken features are broken, e.g., Quick Fill's automatic drop-down lists (annoying) can't be disabled without also disabling the auto completion feature (useful), which is contrary to the online documentation, while other bugs that have been around for four or five versions still haven't been fixed. <br /> <br />Overall very poor execution.  The new features are basically eye candy and don't make up for the loss in functionality.  Stay away if you're a long time user, you're likely to be very unhappy. <br /> <br />Finally, their support staff, while providing timely responses via email, can't help.  They only offer apologies, and recommend making product improvement suggestions.	2006-02-12

It's simply fantastic.  <br /> <br />I don't give it 5 stars because I still think that (even though it's much cheaper than Adobe Photoshop) $300+ is a lot of money for software. <br /> <br />Nonetheless: It's superb. I downloaded a free 15 day trial version from the Corel website and in minutes I was running at full steam ahead. The graphics suite has everything. Really, really, really good!  <br /> <br />Very intuitive. Granted I am familiar with graphics software including Adobe photoshop (not intuitive) and that helps a lot. But still, it's soooooo easy to use. <br /> <br />Amazing. I couldn't ask for more... for now ;-) <br /> <br />Time is money. And this software does it job flawlessly in the blink of an eye.

US	21993074	R3IUP5TY9C1OMJ	B008TN81ZG	364111272	Sketchbook Pro 6	Software	4	5	5	Y	N	Jump Right In	I have worked with Photoshop for years but I wanted to try a sketching program. A long time ago I used Fractal Design's Sketcher and Painter, which were later bought out by Corel. I miss those programs, and I've been away from drawing for some time and I'm not ready to commit to Painter.<br /><br />First, the installation went without a hitch and I haven't had any problems running the software. I do have a Wacom tablet, but so far my rusty drawing skills haven't produced any *art* as I'm just getting used to playing with SketchBook. I do find the pucks a bit confusing, and zooming in and out I went for my control key plus the scroll wheel on my mouse and my drawing disappeared. It wasn't lost, just somewhere out in the margin. I had to read through the help file to figure out how to control the zoom, and it's still awkward. But now I've just figured holding the space key and left mouse button, then dragging, lets me zoom in and out.<br /><br />The brush palette is neat and doesn't take up tremendous screen real estate, and with a second monitor you can drag the palettes over to the secondary monitor, too. The \\"lagoon\\" takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a neat way of adding menus without cluttering the top of the screen.<br /><br />I really like the Copic color library, and especially that it shows complementary colors. The symmetry tool is fun to play with. I was able to open JPG files and Photoshop PSD files for editing, since SketchBook supports layers. I think my discomfort with the program is just from being a n00b and not any problem with the software itself. It seems so like other programs, but some of the tools don't work the way I think they will, and I find myself having to look everything up. I just need time to get comfortable with it.<br /><br />I marked the product down one star because I think there could be better help files or even a tutorial. Yes, playing with the software is the real way to learn it, but fumbling about trying to figure out how to zoom was frustrating, especially since I'd thought I'd lost my art. You can adjust the sensitivity of the stylus and there's a steady stroke option for drawing curves, but I didn't see much difference for what I was drawing. I tried the email option, but it brought up Outlook on my computer, which I've disabled. Oh well. But you can send art as attachments from the program.w to zoom was frustrating, especially since I'd thought I'd lost my art.

Like many other reviewers, I have used many project making software packages over the years. With how expensive greeting cards are these days, it normally pays for its self very quickly plus allows you to really make it personal to the person receiving the card--plus you get to make flyers, banners, etc for free.<br /><br />No brand seems to ever really stack up against the PrintMaster package. The quality of the software, clip art, fonts, etc are the best you will find. I have used 5-6 versions of PrintMaster and loved them all UNTIL this \\"upgrade\\". I am not sure if they sold themselves to another company or just fired everyone responsible for making the good parts of the software but this has been redesigned from the ground up to be just plain crappy. It is slow, buggy, hard to use and full of disappointment. Honestly I wish I could find something I like better than PrintMaster Platinum 18 but there is nothing better and a LOT that is much, much worse.<br /><br />Comparing the two products, this PrintMaster Platinum 2.0 has an average review rating of about 1.5 stars and this is with a ton of Vine reviews--where Amazon & the software company provides free software in exchange for reviews. The Vine reviews tend to be more positive since the person didn't pay anything for the product and because the reviewer feels guilty leaving poor reviews since they were asked by the company to do them. In this case, 7 out of the 9 four star reviews were from vine users and 8 out of the 9 three star reviews were from vine users as well. Removing those \\"purchased\\" ratings, the overall user rating would easily drop to 1 star--the lowest possible rating on Amazon.<br /><br />Whereas, PrintMaster Platinum 18 is currently ranked at 3.5 stars by customers. It is faster, has better templates, better clip art and is better in every way. It is currently even cheaper than this version, but it has been discontinued so you need to grab it before it disappears leaving you with this crappy program as your only option.<br /><br />Click below to find the MUCH better option--PrintMaster Platinum 18.<br />[[ASIN:B000XB21JY Printmaster - Platinum Version 18 [OLD VERSION]]]on.

Pros:     The Total Security package allows me to maintain parental controls, perform update verification on my children's computers and all from a fairly simple interface on my laptop through the home network without using other applications such as VNC or MS Remote Desktop.  Other packages used in the past required manual intervention if the user was not granted Administrator rights on the computer.      Integrated huristic scanning is superior to Norton & McAfee and immediately identified a couple virus' on one pc that neither Norton or McAfee either identified or cleaned.    Cons:      The advanced managment interface is not too intuitive and requires a bit of learning to find all the features that you do not quickly see in the simple mode.  Most users will only use the simple mode and many features will not be fully utilized.

That was remedied and the program worked very nicely.  I didn't have any installation problems with the new Microsoft Streets and Trips 2010, but it doesn't seem to have been updated much from the 2009 edition.  I found that a lot of the roads in our local area that I noticed missing from the 2009 edition had not been added on the 2010 edition even though these roads have been in place for over 10 years.  I also didn't notice a great deal of other enhancements.  A couple of the things that I did like about the 2010 Streets and Trips was the ability to send my routes to my GPS.  That was a problem with the previous edition.  The ability to send my routing and trip plans to my family members was also a nice feature.  That said, if you already have the 2009 edition I wouldn't recommend spending your money for the 2010 edition.  However, if you are looking to buy into the program for the first time, I would give it five stars instead of four.  The program is very nice and it's easy to work with... it's just not a dollar value improvement over the 2009 edition to warrant upgrading.. but first time buyers won't go wrong in buying the 2010 edition.  If you are planning a trip and want to get an idea of what's on the route, when you may need to gas up, what features are along your route, or find some sites to see along your route this is exactly what you need.	2009-12-24

Microsoft word is a very straightforward word processor with more power than the avg person will ever need.  Excel is a fine spreadsheet, Outlook is an excellent e-mail program and the rest of the suite is pretty useful too.   <br /> <br />The easy intergration of these programs pay off pretty well and frankly are are more powerful than most people need.  When you need the features it will really pay off and if you are a student knowing these programs will help when the time to get a job comes around. <br /> <br />There are people who will say that there are other programs out there that are better, that is a matter of opinion.  There are other good programs out there, and if you want to use them fine.   <br />Other say no because they don't like Gates, still others because so many items out there are designed to hit Microsoft products. <br /> <br />If it bugs you to use it then by all means pass it by.  If your main concern is a stable and reliable package that is pretty reliable, a standard for use, and does almost anything a person would want, then pick it up.	2005-12-19

I am a TT Deluxe user for more than 12 years and now I find that after I purchased the Deluxe version this year, it doesn't include everything it did in the past.  I am a realtor and while I can enter my 1099-Misc as usual, if you have expenses totaling more than $100, (uh, who wouldn't in this business, duh??), you need to upgrade to the Home & Business version.  This should have been publicized and they should have done something to change the name of what consumers have been purchasing for many years.      1/20/15 -- As a footnote to the above, I decided to give Intuit a call & see if they would make this right.  They absolutely did.  I imagine they are flooded with complaints & it's a PR nightmare, but in any case, the customer service rep took my info (confirmed my account - I've been a customer for many years) and promptly offered me the download of the upgraded version free of charge.  That made it right in my eyes.  So I would encourage all long time users to call & see what can be done before you proceed & pay for the upgrade. It wasn't right the way they handled it initially, but, at least they are trying to salvage the damage that has been done with this debacle.	2015-01-19

When I purchased this issue of Turbo Tax, I knew that it didn't include the ability to use It's Deductible.  I didn't care because I didn't want to.  My problem is that the software will not acknowledge my donations to charity:  I can enter them when I go through the guide, and they show up within the appropriate fields of the worksheets.  However, they won't go into the tax forms and the data fields that are used to determine my 2009 taxes.     This has never been an issue with the Basic version of Turbo Tax before, but for some reason they've changed it so that you need to buy the Deluxe version in order to take deductions for donations to charity.  After you've already spent twenty plus on this version (Basic), you can upgrade to the Deluxe version for about forty dollars.  Great, but I can now purchase the Deluxe edition for less than that at several discounters.    My attempts to get help via e-mail are unanswered.  I could call a phone agent, but the indicated price is almost thirty dollars per call. My online queries are answered with answers specific to and referencing previous years' versions of Turbo Tax, but not 2009s.    I don't know who at Turbo Tax decided to make these changes, but they aren't doing their customers or the company any favors.      Then again, why do I care, I'm no longer going to be one of their customers.  It gets one star because the review area won't let me give it zero stars.	2010-02-03

The installation was smooth, the scans are quick.  there are a lot of very good features.  But there are some that are very frustrating, if I knew about these I would not have purchased until I knew they were fixed.  After clicking on the desk top icon there is a lag of about 30 seconds to one minute before the program comes up.  when clicking options once it is open there is also an extended lag time before they come up.<br /><br />The most frustrating feature is the secure keyboard/secure data input.  There is a bug with it that will not allow you to use multiple keys on your keyboard such as the @,#,$ any thing you have to hit shift + the key or backspace whenever you are trying to enter a password or secure field even in Ebay search fields.  It is very frustrating.  it was one of the features I purchased this for.  you can disable the secure input but if you don't disable it all it still blocks those keys.  It is extremely difficult to enter passwords etc without the shift key for capital letters or special keys.  Even after the feature is disabled sometimes after a restart it turns itself back on.<br /><br />I have the feature turned off now and it works ok, but why should I have to disable one of the features that sold me on the product in order to use it.  Hopefully a patch for it comes out soon until then I would recommend purchasing another security suite or waiting until this is corrected.	2014-05-13

The software is EXTREMELY buggy! 5.5 is much better, but buggy just the same. This version (and the ones after it) run very slow on every machine I've ever owned. I recently tested this on a dual core intel CPU with 8 gig of ram and SSD's and it was still very sluggish. Worse yet, when you turn on the FTP feature to upload, if you have a large directory to upload from, it will take over 60 seconds to be ready. Then after you upload you need to turn it off, or every page you load and work on will crawl to the screen very slowly. Problem is, when you turn off the ftp feature the software crashes over 80% of the time.<br /><br />In short, don't waste your money! You WILL regret it! As for customer service?

If you change the USB port you installed the GPS on it switches to a different com port and the program has to be re-calibrated.  Starting the GPS tracking function is buried 3 menus deep and is not easy to find when you want it to start NOW!  Mine used to give audible directions till one day it just quit.  And who wants to glance over at their computer every 10 minutes to see if your going the right direction.  IT's not loud enough, so you cant hear the audible commands anyway unless you wear head phones or plug into the AUX of your cars stereo.  Its slow re-routing if you get lost.  And you will get lost.  It doesn't tell you which lane to be in and it gives you goofy instructions, like \\"keep on left and take ramp right.\\"  So do I take the ramp or stay right?  There are too many bells and whistles to the point where it's useless.  Like most Microsoft products its just plain annoying.  If you use this plan on spending half of your time getting lost, getting the GPS to even start,  and once it does start you have to keep your laptop from falling asleep or your GPS will stop working and you have to reconfigure it all over again and wait another 10 minutes. Plus trying to hear what the voices are telling you.  You may actually end up where you wanted to be. Just expect to arrive late, in a bad mood, and in serious need of a stiff drink.  This isnt La Casa Del Rey....Its La Casa Del PIZZA!!!  Ive never felt compelled to write a product review before, but this program is so horrible, consumers out there really need to know.	2007-12-24

Detailed information for your home location (and for any selectable station as well) is only a click away.

Me,I used default \\"C\\".<br /><br />Gone is Wild Card a really cool feature for people who can not spell themselves out of a paper bag. People like me.<br /><br />Eleventh Edition works on Windows 8. It opens from the hard drive on the slow slide but works fine. Word Fetch is cool. Highlight a word in any document when Webster's is open then Control + cc and you get the definition real fast. This Webster's is inferior to the American Heritage Talking Dictionary. However, American Heritage is not compatible passed XP. To bad. it was real cool. It ain't made no mo.<br /><br />The audio pronunciation is cool. Checked tons of words almost every one of them was pronounced.<br /><br />Everything the same for Vista. Vista is slightly faster to open.<br /><br />Am sure the foibles others have mentioned hold true. I registered one license.<br /><br />You get Dictionary/Thesaurus with activation code for two computers. The other stuff is fluff like the Medical Dictionary. Am sure malaria, chicken pox (on your house), cortex this and that, lungs are defined.<br /><br />This Webster's Eleventh is better in my opinion than the OED. OED is a Model \\"T\\" in the 21st Century for 8 times the price. It has no audio pronunciation. And it has built in excessive paranoia. Have two useless versions of this highly regarded scholars lexicon that should not be highly regarded. It is light years behind Webster's in new words. But if you need to Keats on sylvan pastoral Neptune, locks did shed a deafening blindness here and there willy-nilly. Man than this is your cup of tea.<br /><br />The Webster's staff are on the dim/slow witted side. Their answering machines were playing a George Frederick Handle piece that was completely beautiful. They did not even know who Handle was. And were pitifully slow to do anything and in thefinal analysis did nothing. So goes Equal Opportunity... They hang on every word the telephone company will utter. Like they said. Possession is 9/10 of the law. Tough! Fearless leader.	2013-04-24

On the other hand, I'd probably give four stars if this were the only version I were familiar with. I use it daily and don't have any problem with it except a few minor functions don't work as they should. I have not been successful in deleting or renaming accounts after changing credit cards. So- I just remember to enter my Visa card activity into the account into what used to be my Discover card account.  It's a minor annoyance.

This is by far the best language software program that has ever been made. Now the price is extremely fair. I actually paid $195 for the Level 1 product from a kiosk in the local area. The reason I was willing to pay full price for the product was a couple reasons. First the online subscription has issues and doesn't always seem to run smoothly. Second, I received a great demonstration of the product from the sales associate at a local kiosk. Third, Amazon only gives me 30 days to evaluate the product. If I am not satisfied with the purchase, I have to pay a 20% restocking fee. I want to be able to use the program without having to worry about being online at the same time. And finally if you buy directly from a kiosk, you get 6 months to evaluate the product. There is no restocking fee with a purchase made at a local kiosk.	2006-04-27

Each new update makes things even better. I have yet to install an update that bricked the OS, in fact it just makes the whole thing run better. The included Microsoft Edge browser works very well. I'm glad Microsoft abandoned IE and rebuilt it from the ground up. Its very speedy and has no problems with rendering websites. Games have also been running well, perhaps even better then 7. I do find the so called &#34;apps&#34; to be pretty useless when running on a computer. I tend to use the browsers version of Facebook more often then the app, for example. It just seems redundant. I'm sure they are great for tablets, however.  I would like to point out that I am not being payed to say this, i'm just an average computer user who has been satisfied with Windows 10.   I am well aware of all of the controversy about privacy, forced updates, ect. I decided to upgrade from Windows 7 anyways, as I knew I could always roll back if I had any problems.  Windows Updates: People have been reporting that updates occasionally fail, causing the computer to revert the update. When the computer restarts, the update starts downloading again, with no easy way to stop it. This has never happened to be on both computers I updated, but I won't say that this problem doesn't exist for other users. People also complain that the the computer restarts to install an update while you are working on something. Again, this has never happened to me. In fact, I actually have to manually restart the computer, as it doesn't do it on its own.  New interface: Not as bad as some people are claiming. Sure, some of the icons have a flat, dull look to them, but they do fit in with the rest of the interface, and it is possible to change the icons back if you really don't like them. The new start menu isn't as good as the ones used in XP, Vista, and 7, but it is functional. The all apps list requires a lot more scrolling, which i'm not thebiggest fan of, but I can deal with it because I can pin my favorite apps to either the taskbar, or the right side of the start menu.  Stability: Some of the apps in the Windows Store crash right when you open them, but they really aren't optimized for Windows 10 yet. I use my computer for at least 5 hours daily, and not once have I gotten a BSOD.  I would like to point out that i'm not a Windows fanboy at all. I'm comfortable with Linux and Mac, but I find the Windows interface to work better for my needs. When Windows 8 came out, I avoided it as best I could. It was not user friendly with a keyboard and mouse, which Windows 10 has fixed.	2015-08-25

I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.<br /><br />This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.<br /><br />Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks.

Maybe this is why Turbo Tax sells extra audit protection?

I purchased this software to improve my digital image workflow & for tethered shooting.  I also liked the idea of being able to create a photo book from within the program.  I have been a \\"nearly daily\\" photoshop user for close to 20 years.<br /><br />I find Lightroom 4 to be SLOW, GLITCHY & DIFFICULT TO USE!  My computer easily meets the hardware requirements, but nearly everything about this program runs slowly.  Whenever you switch \\"modules\\" it stutters and slows and breaks your concentration.  The \\"Import\\" function in the Library Module is painfully slow.  It SLOWLY finds all of the drives and storage devices on your system.  I have checked and apparently there is no way to exclude some of the drives or devices on your system.  The program \\"looks nice\\" on the screen and perhaps this is one of the reasons it runs so slowly?  Give me a stripped down version that runs faster!  It is supposed to be for \\"professional photographers\\", but I know of no pro photographer that wants to sit around waiting for their computer to respond.<br /><br />I am finding that I GREATLY PREFER Adobe Bridge and Photoshop for most of the functions that this program provides.  I purchased a book on how to use Lightroom 4 and that book even states that the program runs slowly, locks up, etc.  The book advises that you just sit and wait for it to resume running correctly.<br /><br />If you make any changes to your file structure in another program (or move a file), the program can't find the proper folder & you have to start over.  I have yet to use the \\"photo book\\" module, but expect it to be slow and glitchy as well.  Come on Adobe, get the program to run FAST and work the BUGS out BEFORE releasing it!  At this point I have to wonder if the good reviews I am reading are written from people within the company.	2012-11-10

However, it is important that as they grow up they learn to use a keyboard. I've tried a few online typing programs for my now 8 year old, all were free except Type to Learn 4 which was really repetitive and did not hold her interest quiet as well. With Typing Instructor Platinum for Kids, she asks to do typing lessons and finds them really engaging. The lessons aren't too long and because you race against the clock, even the instruction portion is somewhat of a game, and then there are plenty of games to break things up too. My daughter loves this part of our school day. She had no problem with having virtually no computer or keyboarding skills and jumping right into this program. I give it 5 stars bc it is academically superior to the free online typing programs I've found, including one paid one, and is so much more engaging. I have sat down and enjoyed it a time or two too, just to experience the content of the program before turning her loose with it. If a child enjoys something, they are more apt to stick with it and when learning is fun retension is better.	2013-02-10

I used Photoshop 7 for over 2 yrs at work, & took a night course to really learn how to use it to the fullest. I was blown away. I'm buying Photoshop 5.0 LE for my Mom today, so she can do all kinds of neat things with her digital camera photos. A MUST BUY in photo editing & for the \\"newbies\\" on computers. Good Luck!	2007-09-09

I'd been a long-time user of Jasc/Corel Paint Shop Pro and Paint Shop Photo Pro and was considering the upgrade to version X2. Professionals and home-users alike sang the praises of PSE 6 so I thought I'd give it a try. Adobe offers a 30 day no restrictions \\"tryout version\\" that is available and that's what won me over. Adobe has included a number of features from the full-blown Photoshop into PSE and it really is an incredibly powerful photo editor.   There are a number of third-party books available to help you with the learning curve. My recommendation is Barbara Brundage's \\"Photoshop Elements 6 - The Missing Manual.\\" It isn't tutorial-based but it leads you through the features and functions of PSE 6 in a logical step-by-step process. Its very well written and easy to follow.	2008-02-25

This may affect performance.  Anyway, although I find it annoying that the way you do anything like navigation is very non-Windows and, to me, non-intuitive,on my machine page turns are fast (using DVDs), only a bit of zooming (with the mouse scroll wheel) makes the pages very readable, page rotation is easy, searches work well.  I agree that, since the magazine is presented as two page spreads, a wide screen monitor is ideal.    But even with \\"check for updates\\" the problems with, for example, April 1954 contents being where April 1953 should be remain..those problems are not fixed on the DVDs. Maybe if I install to hard drive the update fixes this?  Don't know, haven't tried that!	2010-10-22

The software is NOT made to take you from point A to point B.  It is MAP software but really good stuff!    This is for use with Overland Navigator.  Although I use a hybrid topo/highway type Garmin Nuvi for navigation, this software is used on my 10\\" floor mounted netbook and shows in great detail the immediate surrounding area.  An example:  The Garmin shows me the street, this software shows me all the streets in an area around the street which can be zoomed in or out.  For off-road navigation, I can see in an instant where a dirt trail is going to take me and all those parallel trails that make you nuts now all visible at the same time.  With the Overland Navigator GPS software which drives this map, I can really get the same view as a helicopter!  I contacted the product developer and he was very helpful and very nice about being helpful.  The product is very simple to use and understand.  No frills, JUST good stuff!	2010-12-08

Till now, I've experienced many tools including Notepad, Vi (Unix's editor, like window's Notepad), CMed, HotDog, Homesite, Netscape's composer, Frontpage, Dream weaver.<BR>My first experience with NetObject starting from NetObject 4.0, then, I was impressive how productivity it is, although it's still not perfect at that time. I feel satisfied &amp; comfortable with this kind of WYSIWYG tools since the NetObjects MX was born.<BR>For NetObjects MX, I would like to share my opinions here,<br />1. NetObjects MX is not only the best tool for beginners, also inlcuding sophisticated guys. If you assume it is designed for beginners only, you are wrong.<br />   NetObjects MX provide many flexible ways to access your HTML coding. If you do know what is HTML, and you are willing to spend time to learn NetObjects MX, you'll find there is no &quot;limitation&quot;.<br />2. Yes, NetObjects produces large HTML files, however it won't sacrifice website download speed too much. The real problem to slow down your website download speed mostly come from the large graphics &amp; multimedia files.<br />3. Compared with Frontpage &amp; Dreamweaver, NetObjects provides a effective way to increase your productivity with much lower cost.<br />So, I have to say &quot;thank you&quot; to NetObjects, which is a ideal tool. and it's so happy to hear NetObjects Phoenix is coming soon.	2002-05-27

Though I have used McAfee for over 10 years. I prefer the CD of previous years but this year McAfee just gives you a card with a code on the back. You do have to follow the instruction that comes with the card. You have to type in a specific site, don't depend on your browser to &#34;call up&#34; the exact web address to click on. Just go ahead and type in the address EXACTLTY.<br />  On my first install attempt I did get an error message: 0 (zero). To correct that I was asked if I wanted to down load the McAfee files manually. I clicked on that option. The program basically restarted. I am on DSL for my desktop, it took about an hour to do the download, another 30 minutes to remove my old McAfee Total Protection and install the new one. Success<br />  I wanted to install this on my laptop as well, but 90 minutes was too long to wait. So I went to work where there is high speed Wi-Fi. I installed the second Total Protection on my lap top in about 20 minutes.<br />Again you do have some very specific instructions that come with this download. The CD of the past was easier to install. However a new feature of this 2015 Total Protection is a very useful file call Vault. You can create a file (up to one GB) that only you can get into with a Password. This &#34;Vault&#34; file gets put into your Documents folder automatically. Great for storing pictures, documents, information, address, phone numbers that only you have access too. Great deterrent for nosey wives.	2014-12-31

Since I have more time to train it at home, I was hoping to export my profile from home PC to my office PC to save time training two machines.  Unfortunately, Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 Home version does not have an export/import profile feature as the Premium version does.  Searching for ways to find where the profile file is located so that I can copy has not been successful.  I think Nuance made a GROSS mistake in cutting the profile export/import feature from the Home version.  I've wasted more time than I have to figure out how to export my profile.  As for the Premium version, I bought it and was hope to use it with a bluetooth headset.  Unfortuantely, Premium version only works with a limited number of bluetooth headsets, and I cannot get my Plantronic Voyager Pro to work.  I'd have to spend about a hundred bucks to get a Plantronic Calisto, if I want bluetooth connectivity.

Its incredible how customizable it is, and i can see why so many schools have implemented it into their curriculum. That being said, their customer service is second to none. I have made about 3 calls into them about different questions on how to perfectly customize the program to my needs.

I have given this software a good chance to win me over, but so far, no go.  I installed it on an almost-new computer.  Installation went fine, but use of the program, even with its supplied written manual, was difficult.  The supposed step-by-step approach in the beginners mode simply does not exist or I cannot find it.  However, having used Nero 8 and being familiar with editing, I was able to excerpt three video clips and splice them together with a title card.  However, when I wanted to output them to a DVD, I was given multiple choices of formats with no explanation as to which is best for what, neither within the menus of choice or in the manual.  Trial and error did not achieve success.  When attempting to burn a DVD in all modes, the process froze at about 20% of completion and I never have made it to 100%.<br /><br />The basic tools seem complete and obviously others have had success with it.  But they need a better set of explanations for the beginner like me, perhaps with written step by step instructions on how to achieve one sort of project or another.  I have had this software on my machine for a month now and \\"play\\" with it periodically, but am extremely disappointed with it and would warn others to download this on a trial basis to see if it is for you before shelling out the bucks.	2009-04-06

When I tried to used it, I was bothered by being required to activate since my Internet connection is pretty poor and sometimes these things time out before anything happens. However it was a very quick process.  On getting started I found the user interface to be easy and the activities, which might be better described as drills than lessons, are fun. I have made very good progress in a short space of time, and expect to continue. This software will be with me for a long time.  The courses are: 1. Interval comparison, a set of A or B questions asking the user to determine the greater of two intervals played either as chords or intervals. Starts off with unison and seconds and progressively includes more intervals. 2. Interval identification. similar to the above. 3. Interval singing. I have not tried this yet, as I have not got a microphone, but I would imagine it is like the two previous activities. 4.Chord Identification. Chords are played as arpeggios or chords. Questions ask whether the chords heard are either major or minor. Then sus4 chords are added and so on. 5. Chord inversions. Asks the user to identify which inversion of a chord is being played. 6. Chord progressions. Again a series of progressive multiple choice tests. Starts off with obvious stuff like majors and minors, but quickly moves on to dim7s and chords with b5 and b9. As the jazzier chords came in, I found the only way to get there was to figure out the answers at a keyboard. Time-consuming, but valuable for the musician whose aural skills are not exceptional. 7. Scale identification. Not there yet. I would suppose this is a progressive activity kicking off with major scales and running on to the various minors, modes and synthetic scales. 8. Rhythmic sight-reading. Asks the user to tap a rhythm scored on the screen against a metronomic beat provided by the software. Speed of metronome is variable. The beats provided by the user are marked on the score and uses arrows to show whether the taps vary from being dead on the metronome. Again progressive. Would be a very good way to start learning to read music from scratch. 9. Rhythmic imitation. Similar to the above, but the software plays a rhythm which the user copies. 10. Rhythmic dictation. The third side to the triangle formed by the previous to rhythm exercises. A beat is played which the user scores on the screen. 11. Rhythmic Error Detection. Not tried yet, but I would suppose these are exercises in finding discrepancies between written and sounded rhythms. 12. Melodic sight singing. Due to not having a mic, I have not tried this, but suppose it will be similar to number 14 13. Melody imitation. Probably singing back a played melody. 14. Melodic dictation. Scoring played notes by ear. Starts of using only the first two notes of the major scale and progressively adds notes.  After the &#34;classical&#34; Lessons described above, the jazz mode has courses similar to #s 4, 6, and 8 through 14 listed above.  I have been looking for this kind of drilling training for many years and this, so far, has satisfied all my expectations.  As a side note, I would also say that my ear was re-educated electronically by the Tomatis method many years ago. I did this because I was working with a speech therapist as an English teacher for her clients who had had their ears opened by the use for filtered sounds, vibrators passing sounds directly through the skull thus bypassing the normal hearing filters and other fairly freaky methods. The Tomatis method is widely regarded by academics as nonsense, probably in part because Dr. Alfred Tomatis talks like a mystic instead of a doctor, but the results I saw, both in my language students and in myself were amazing. e.g. my voice immediately became much more resonant to the extent that my father did not recognise it when he phoned. Also my French accent went from being awful (people used to believe I was doing it on purpose) to reasonable, though still a long way from being passable as a native speaker. Having a reasonable, probably average, ability to process sounds gives me the basis for being able to profit from this course. I suspect there will be people whose hearing, that is to say brain processing of sounds, is so poor that even with a course like this, there ears will simply refuse to process the sounds and so will not benefit very much from the training.  There is a good reason that the ear refuses to process sounds: it is very demanding of the attention. Immediately after learning to hear clearly - it was the aural equivalent of putting on new glasses - I found it more difficult to concentrate on such activities as abstract logic. Even today, I am more sensitive to noise interruptions than most people, but it is a trade off I am very happy to pay.	2015-07-23

Many people did not like the ribbon and the major changes to the interface from previous versions of Office, but I find the new features and layout to be very intuitive and easy to use. For most people, the home and student edition of Office will be all they will need, so I would recommend it over the more expensive versions that include database components and such unless you have a particular need for it. As usual, there is backward-compatibility with previous versions, so there is no concern if you have a horde of files in earlier version formats--they will work just fine.<br /><br />On a slightly different note, I am not pleased with the direction that MS and so many other software providers are going with cloud-based products. The cloud is convenient certainly, but the idea of renting software as opposed to owning it seems outrageous to me. I am far more comfortable with my installation disc in hand and knowing that I actually own the product that I am using. For this reason alone I will not upgrade to cloud-based software that is rented on an annual or monthly basis.	2013-04-27

If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.<br /><br />A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard.<br /><br />So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts.<br /><br />There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use.<br /><br />1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement.<br /><br />2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about.<br /><br />Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works.<br /><br />This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for.without headaches in trying to fix the formatting.

I do not normally review products, but I feel that I must prevent anyone else from making the mistake of purchasing this package.  Sure, it's a slick piece of work, with lots of entertaining videos and cool graphics.  The problem is that it leaves it up to the user to make the same computations and pore over the same IRS publications that we buy tax software (and hire tax professionals) to help us avoid.  Here's my story:  After spending hours entering names, addresses, phone numbers, tax ID numbers for employers, dates of birth and SSNs for the kids, and earnings from the W-2's, I come to fun part -- the itemized deductions.  Want to guess what Turbotax told me?  It said that I would need to obtain IRS Publication 525 (it's approximately 40 pages long, and not included on the CD-ROM), complete the worksheet in that publication (??!!!), then enter the result in the box Turbotax provides.  WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN, GET THE PUBLICATION AND DO THE WORKSHEET??!!  Why would I buy software if I wanted to wrangle with IRS publications, do the math myself, and make the same judgment calls on my own that tax programs are supposed to help you make?  Such a bad, bad, BAD program.  I'm sure my accountant will be snickering as he completes my request for an automatic extension next week.  Here's the \\"bottom line\\" -- if your taxes are at all complex, do not buy this program.  As for me, I'm going to see if Turbotax is any more truthful with its \\"satisfaction guarantee\\" than it was with its statements regarding the program's completeness.	2002-04-05

I am not a mega tech person, I simply want my computers protected.  I have gone back and forth (for the most part) with McAfee and Norton.  Last year I used the McAfee LiveSafe security and have no issues or threats to my computer, but was up for trying a new system as my current subscription was up.  Similarly to the McAfee, you receive a credit card like card that has a code that you enter on the Norton.com/setup website.  This then walks you through the steps of setup and gives you the option for using it with also your smartphone and tablets.  There is a dashboard where you can conveniently look at each different device and see their current status.  I have not set it up with my smartphone yet, but I can see the value in having it protected in case of loss.  Overall, it has felt very similiar to what I previously had, and although it has not given me problems, I am not sure it was worth it to uninstall of my past system to put in a very comparable one.	2014-10-19

I does impoirt data from the prior year's return and from <br />Money, etc.  However, when you go to file it asks you to manually look up adjusted gross amounts from both Federal and  <br />State returns from the previous year - telling you which lines <br />on the returns to look at - even though it alreadey had imported <br />these amounts for other purposes. It also does little for State <br />tax complexities except to tell you to read the instructions for <br />the State return. I don't kenow of any automated program that <br />offers any real help with State returns. <br />	2006-02-21

This may be creative with pretty graphics and pictures but is probably the worst software I've ever bought. Neither myself nor my two very computer-literate children could figure out how to get the interactive story to run. I called the support line in Europe and they also did not know. The instructions that accompany it were also not helpful. I finally sent email to the support group and they never answered my email. I'm very disappointed with this software.	2001-08-28

I have used in now since 2002, and this year's edition is no disappointment.  Easy installation, easy updates, and easy to use interface.  Simple questions prompt you to enter needed info, and if your employer and banks/financial institutions participate, you can even import your interest and capital gains/losses right in, without have to figure it and enter it by hand.      This particular version is perfect for the small business owner, or the independent contractor who wants to be honest on their taxes and pay the SE tax.  The first time I used it was the year after I'd paid a large commercial tax filing service $400 to do our taxes: my wife had just begun working as a contractor, and I had just starting receiving dividend, interest, and capital gains from investments I'd made.  Figuring the SE tax, doing schedule C, and figuring everything on schedule D for the investments was a daunting challenge.    TurboTax to the rescue.  Easy, fast, affordable.  I spent $75 or so instead of $400, didn't spend any time in a tax office, and in an hour or two, had done my taxes legally.  Efile is amazing, too; click, and you've filed!  Your refund will be in the bank in less than 2 weeks.    It's really hard for me to understand the 1-star reviews.  If you don't like these products, then I guess you won't like this year's version, either.  But if you're new to the market, I highly recommend using a TurboTax product.  If you have your own business, as well as investments, this particular version will make your life so much simpler!  You may even begin to look forward to tax time!  (err, maybe not)    Give it a shot, and I don't believe you'll be disappointed.	2010-01-30

I have been using Photoshop CS3 for years.  Originally with a Nikon D80.  Now I am using  a Nikon D3100.  CS3 will no open RAW Images from the new camera.  SO I was hesitant to order the new version (i.e. Photoshop CS5).  Well searching Adobes updates and downloads I found out that all I needed to do to fix this problem was download and install RAW Plugin update 6.3.  That update could not be installed on photoshop CS3, si I ordered Photoshop CS5.  I ordered and recieved Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended Student Teacher version.  Unfortunately it arrived and was installed Friday April 8th 2011.  Now I'm trying to get the necessary RAW Plugin undate version 6.3.  How difficult can it be?  Very very difficult.  How many pages of instructions?  Many finally you get to a download and install command.  What do you do when it doesn't work.  Call for help...  Help is not available on the weekend.    I've been working on trying again and again, to find and install the necessary update.  Unfortunately Adobe does not provide support on weekends, and finding and installing this little update in not easy.  Why is it not easy?  I do not know.   I have to wait until Monday 7:00 AM to get help.     If you are thinking about getting Adobe Photoshop CS5, I wish you the best of luck.  You'll need it.  I wait until Monday and I will either get the update I need or I will return the product to Amazon.	2011-04-09

It's a bug ridden piece of c**p which is badly in need of some serious delousing. The program is supposed to learn how to better recognize when speech went used to correct mistakes (I was dictating this -- does that tell you something?). Unfortunately, its learning behaviour suggests that the parents of this program both had the same surname. I spend quite a bit of time correcting errors, despite all the error-correction and training with which it has been provided. Program has a number of bugs which have required re-installation, but have recurred nonetheless. Many claimed features of the program don't work. Technical support are unfathomably ignorant. Program does not permit reliable dictation in some programs with which the seller claims it is designed to be compatible (produces incoherent gibberish and random results in tables in WordPerfect, stutters and produces erratic results in Corel Presentations. Company spends more time engaged in hard-sell telephone calls to customers than in actually paying programmers to create a quality product. Overall assessment -- don't bother -- Windows 7 pro, ultimate, or enterprise versions have speech recognition built-in. Recognition and learning seem to be just as good as Dragon, although one can't create custom commands as in Dragon. The free, included Windows version provides, however, enormously greater functionality at browsing the web by voice and activating commands in applications than Dragon, and is in that way actually superior. Had I to do it again, I wouldn't waste any money on Dragon and would just use the free speech recognition which comes with Windows. Either way, buy a good quality USB microphone-headset -- cheap microphones don't give good sound quality, leading to poor recognition accuracy.	2013-03-25

If that was all I wanted to use it for I would have given it 5 stars. However, there are some vast deficiencies. The biggest problem in my opinion is with the text editor. There is no spell check, you cant tab to begin new paragraphs, you can't change your font or write anything in bold, italics, or underline, cant set margins, cant indent, etc. Basically the text editor is non existant. Its a shell and thats all. <br /> <br />Aside from that I feel like it doesnt really fit for all kinds of writing. The descriptions in the story creation part are vague. They say that they are like that to give you room for imagination. But the problem is that they are so vague its almost as if it told you nothing at all. They kind of dont make any sense.  <br /> <br />It seems to only offer one view point to a story. Their process is stuck on Hero vs. Antagonist. There is no story line for two heroes or two antognists. Plus the antagonist is assumed to be bad when not all books have a bad character in that sense. For example, this doesnt really work for romances. <br /> <br />I found that as I wrote and then moved on to the next stage, that stage turned out to be what I thought I was already writing, or that I wasnt sure what stage what I wrote belonged in. I ended up abandoning that part of the program all together and went back to using MS Word. Now I just use it as a place to store ideas and organize my characters. <br /> <br />Their website says you can get a full refund if you arent satisfied but they offer no phone number or email address to do that and the support people dont write back. I started trying to get my money back over a week before the time ran out and no one contacted me. Now its past the date and I'm stuck with a program that doesnt quite do all it boasts.  <br /> <br />In my opinion its not worth the money.	2005-12-21

Fine federal, weak state tax program	Back when I did my 2005 taxes, I swore I would never go back to TaxCut.  I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.    When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back\\" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'      PROS:  1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with  TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)   2. Reasonable interface  3. Reasonably priced  4. Federal forms worked smoothly  5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax  6. Much improved DeductionPro  7. Easy e-file    CONS:  1.I think TurboTax still has the edge...  2 Poor integration with state forms  3.So-so interview for state forms  4.Poor help files for state forms  5.DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable  6.Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.    So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised.I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)    Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.    THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.   The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.    On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.    DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.    FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.    E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect    CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.      Problems included:   1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.   2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep  3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)    Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...    STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.    The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.    The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was true for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.    The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.      Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.    One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)    SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.     On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking.	2009-03-13

This is the second edition I've installed; it upgrades the 2005 version previously installed.  My only complaint so far is not entirely the fault of the program; installation on an AOL (I'm sorry) broadband connection that drops on restart confuses the install wizard.  However, during the upgrade install it uninstalls the older version including the white- and black-list sites so you are forced to retrain the program.  The client is not a sophisticated user (see the AOL reference), but did not have many questions or issues with the use of the program.  I like to have an alternative to Norton as the sub-minimal level of non-support for Symantec's customer base has managed to find even worse levels of non-service.	2006-02-25

There are no earth-shaking changes for me and there were no great error corrections in this version. I could easily live with M2002 for another year, but I do like to have the latest version when practical. If it is your first version, it is definitely worthwhile. The planner functions are great and, so far, the competition has gotten better but still not as good as M2003.	2002-11-12

I had it set up on my computer within ten minutes, and with very little tutoring from the instruction guide, was able to browse to the music loop library, \\"paint\\" out loops on the multi-track display, modify loop characteristics like reverb and bass, and so forth.  Obviously, Acid Music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone.  This software cannot generate its own unique loops, so I wound up having to find a MIDI program that would let me create original loops for making truly original music.  But as a non-musician who hosts a radio program and is a bona fide electronic music fan, Acid Music 3.0 made it super easy to assemble my MIDI tracks into pretty good sounding pieces.  I would recommend this program to anyone, musician or non-musician, interested in breaking into the world of digital computer music creation.  It's been almost three months since my wife gave me my copy as a gift, and I've managed to put together many different kinds of pieces of music, using both original content and the great loops that come with the program.  It's a lot of fun, and has me hungering to see what more I can do with the thing.	2003-03-06

Initially, the product seemed to do the job, although admittedly, I was never 100% successful at getting some of the features, like the non-stop backup, to work. Never the less, when I manually ran my backups, they worked and I liked being able to browse the backup sets to pluck out individual files.  I recently upgraded to the 2012 version with PlusPack. A few weeks after I installed, the product stopped working. The Acronis services are still running background, but the user interface won't start and therefore you can't do anything with the product. I tried all the usual stuff, uninstall / reinstall, researched the problem via Google and Acronis's knowledge base, but have not found anything relevant to my issue. I finally broke down and went to contact support only to find that support is only good for 30 days (my product actually failed within that window, but I hadn't had time to troubleshoot the issue until a few weeks later). What I found is that past the 30 day window, you have to pay *$10 PER INCIDENT* which is ridiculous. I emailed customer support to complain about this since my product failed in the window and have received no response after several days.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with Acronis. I would understand lack of support for a product that I have owned for years, but since I just upgraded and it is the new product that has failed, it should be covered (and for more than 30 days). But, to not even contact me after only being 2 weeks out of a VERY short support window is poor form. Further, to charge a a support fee equivalent to 25-50% of my purchase price adds insult to injury. I will find a different company that actually stands behind their product and users. I suggest you do the same.	2012-02-21

Automated bibliography generation being so \\"last century,\\" I'll mainly evaluate Sente here as an academic literature discovery and organizing tool.  Suffice it to say that Sente's bibliography creation capabilities have worked flawlessly for me with Word 2004, perfectly formatting references for a number of different journals.  I haven't had opportunity to try it out with Mellel, Nisus, Pages, or Word 2008, so will leave it to others to comment on those.  I'm an EndNote refugee, having used that program back when it was a cottage-industry application from Niles Software.  Under the stewardship of behemoth Thompson Scientific, however, it seemed only to get clunkier and buggier and never blossomed into the all-around literature manager found in Sente.    Sente and Papers, in contrast, are leading the way into the 21st century with a markedly broader view of what an academic reference manager should be, although the latter application still requires you to keep ol' EndNote around (and thus maintain parallel libraries) for bibliography creation.  Aside from that critical distinction, they are probably more similar than different, so I'll start with the commonalities. Note that I'm comparing Sente version 5.7 and Papers 1.8.    Both Sente and Papers provide rich feature sets for searching online databases like PubMed and downloading, importing, organizing -- even reading -- PDFs, and both, smartly, have taken major interface cues from Apple's iTunes.  \\"Collections\\" allow references to be organized manually (by drag-and-drop), while \\"smart collections,\\" much like iTunes' smart playlists, filter down whatever they're nested in according to saved criteria.  Unlike EndNote's \\"groups,\\" collections can be hierarchically nested within one another, and smart collections can be nested within regular collections or even (Sente only) within each other, for ultimate organizational nirvana.  Time to surplus that old Steelcase file cabinet?    The tabbed interfaces allow you to open multiple PDFs at once without the clutter of multiple windows.  For those for whom \\"read\\" is an active verb, Sente and Papers both provide a Notes pane for jotting comments which are stored with the reference.    Lastly, Sente and Papers provide similar functionality for keeping the physical PDF files organized on your hard drive -- automatically renaming and filing downloaded PDFs according to user preferences -- as well as automatic retrieval of reference metadata from online sources for PDFs you already have.  It should never again be necessary to wonder what's in a file called \\"fulltext.pdf,\\" (no thanks here to the publishing industry for never quite getting this).    The Differences    Here's where Sente's version 5.x maturity inevitably begins to show.  First, Sente provides a more diverse array of internet searching methods.  It's oldest (and often still the best) method is to use a menu-driven interface to define a PubMed (or Web of Knowledge, Z39.50 data source, etc.) search.  These can incorporate nested Boolean logic (unlike Papers', or even EndNote's, more limited sequential Boolean logic).  The most unique and powerful feature of this type of Sente search, however, is that it can be: (1) saved (Papers remembers only the last 5 searches for any given data source); (2) set to automatically rerun on a regular basis, flagging new references for your attention; and (3) nested within collections so that newly discovered references are automatically added right into your organizational schema.    A lot of literature discovery these days doesn't happen through formal searching, but rather through the \\"related articles\\" or \\"cited articles\\" listings found on many websites.  Sente's \\"Targeted Browsing\\" feature incorporates a tabbed web browser that uses Safari's data detector technology to automatically detect references on a fast growing list of supported websites (PubMed, [...], Science Direct, Wiley InterScience, etc.).  Articles not already in your Sente library are flagged with a target icon;  clicking on it acquires the reference metadata, adding it to the currently selected collection.  A follow-up click on the PDF link will download and properly attach the PDF.  PDF links on websites not yet supported by Targeted Browsing can also be used to download and import PDFs, with Sente then retrieving the metadata from PubMed or Google Scholar, thus making essentially any website fair game for reference acquisition.    Sente also provides a significantly richer suite of organizational tools, including color-coding references according to user-defined \\"status\\" terms, multiple libraries, user-defined fields and keywords, multiple notes per reference, support for multiple reference types (43 built-in, plus user definable -- Papers currently only supports journal articles), and the capability to attach multiple files per reference, including PDFs, RTF files, etc.    Papers does have some unique features.  Perhaps one of the biggest is that it maintains a Spotlight index of attached PDFs, so that internal searches can burrow into PDF content.  Sente, in contrast, searches only reference metadata, although it does helpfully highlight occurrences of search terms in titles, abstracts, keywords, etc., so you immediately see why a given reference was found.    Another feature much appreciated by Papers aficionados is its fullscreen reading mode, which hides clutter to promote zen-like concentration.  I rather suspect, however, that many Papers and Sente users do much of their heavy reading in either Preview or the even more full-featured Skim, both of which provide highlighting and annotating tools that neither Papers nor Sente currently offer.  In fact, Skim has its own fullscreen mode, complete with the aforementionedmarkup functionality, making it (in many users' minds) a virtually indispensable companion to either Sente or Papers (and it's freeware!).  Now, if either of these reference management apps were to bring Skim's top-notch markup tools into their feature set...    Keep a watch on this innovative application, bringing a fresh approach to reference management.  Someday, thousands of years from now, archeologists will unearth a Macintosh computer from the excavation site of a 21st century university, dissect its contents, and write that the early 21st century was truly the \\"golden age\\" of academic reference management.	2008-12-01

We have exclusively used WordPerfect as a word processor for over 20 years. In the last year the different flavors of the software we have loaded became corrupted and very erratic.  So we did some research and decided to try WordPerfect Home & Student Office X4 after trying Open Office and finding it did not do all the graphics and margin manipulation my wife does as a minister who creates her own church materials.      The package came in a very large, highly illustrated (Big Store) box measuring 9 1/2 inches long, 8 inches wide and nearly 2 inches thick.  Inside there was another cardboard box for rigidity, but then only an install CD, a fonts/photos/gimmicks CD, a Training Video CD and a single sheet \\"freebie\\"ad for Stamps,com. In short, there was this huge box for just 3 CDs in white envelopes.    THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION OF ANY KIND save for fine print systems requirements on the outside box.  There was no offer of support or a listing anywhere of an email address or telephone number to go to with questions about installing the suite with prior editions of WP already on your computer.  Put in another way, the only guidance in the whole package was an instruction to \\"Put disk #1 in your CD-ROM drive.\\" In much bigger letters on the outside of the package was a warning:  \\"INSTALL ON UP TO 3 COMPUTERS.\\"  This was a big surprise as we have 4 computers and if the sales info on the Internet had mentioned a limited license we never would have bought it. We also would not have bought it if we knew the company would not show respect to their user base.    We still think WordPerfect features are  the best on the market but also think it is very sad  to find that Corel Corporation does an even worse job than Microsoft in respecting and being responsive to the reasonable needs of their customers.	2008-10-13

The only reason I give this software 4 stars is because you can only put it on one computer and if you have multiple computers, you have to buy another copy (the main reason I liked Student/Teacher versions--you have 3 computers you can install software on) and the price.

I purchased this product at Costco.        I contacted tech support and downloaded updated databases. I actually did this before and again after contacting support. This did not work so I am still waiting on another response from tech support.        By the way...I believe this item IS returnable to the manufacturer. Check the manufacturer's website! They give instructions for returning the product if you are not satisfied. I will be doing this myself if I do not get some workable solutions.    August 4, 2004    Well...I finally received a response back from tech support.  They did/could not help me any further.  In fact, their only suggestion is that I return the product for a refund which is exactly what I will do.  I knew this was too good a value for the money to be true.  I am currently looking at Pro Show Gold.  I have downloaded the trial version and so far it seems to work with my hardware.  The price comparison is not even close, but then you tend to get what you pay for.    As for this product, I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only saving grace is the return policy!	2004-08-03

I had previously used Norton / Symantec for over 10 years with only minor complaints.  Recently though I noticed that all of the great things I once loved about Norton / Symantec were disappearing - [[ASIN:B000BARBRE Norton Personal Firewall 2006]], [[ASIN:B0002UCWIG Norton SystemWorks 2005 [AntiVirus, Utilities, GoBack, Check IT]]], [[ASIN:B0002RPZQU Norton AntiSpam 2005 - Single User]], etc.  Sure these items are now all under the umbrella Norton Antivirus / Systemworks - but they do not have all of the older features that were so customizeable.  And don't even bother asking about their Mac tools - like [[ASIN:B00009U14R Norton Systemworks for Mac 3.0]] - these are few and far between with limited results.  I finally jumped ship and went with the company that I had been using as a free crutch for nearly 10 years as well.<br /><br />Trend Micro's home page offers scans and repairs... but that only really helps after the damage is done.  I discovered it about 2001 after getting a virus that my Norton failed to pick up in my email.  So this year I decided to entrust Trend again by purchasing their antivirus for my PC & Mac, and so far so good.  I was amazed that this is on USB, wish it was for the [[ASIN:B001V9VERW Trend Smart Surfing for Mac]] also.  Trend vs Norton - so far win Trend.  Trend runs smoother in the background than [[ASIN:B000T9LUB0 Norton Antivirus 2008 1 User [OLD VERSION]]] that I had been running.  I didn't notice as many lags in internet useage and even was doing usual work while a scan was performed not knowing that it was going the whole time.  Sure I operate XP with 4GB of RAM, but previously Norton significantly slowed down my system while scanning.  I am normally running mostly text heavy programs not multimedia, so this could be drastically different for gamers / video & music users.<br /><br />The standout feature of it all has to be the USB.  I can't imagine now why more companies wouldn't do this with the low cost of thumb flash style drives.  I usually try to keep most program discs and over the years they get beaten up pretty bad.  I would love to have some system tool programs on a USB thumb sized drive to easily run on other computers around work - just keep it in my pocket or in my lap top bag.<br /><br />The USB made it nice to have a durable and quick loading install without the worries of a scratched disc.

Files on SendStuffNow's servers are also encrypted with AES 256 bit keys.<br /><br />Simple, right...  It gets better.<br /><br />A great feature of SendStuffNow is its file delivery management. You can track file downloads, get notified when recipients download their files, and finally remove access to a file at any time.  In short: You control the file from beginning to end.<br /><br />To make things even easier, SendStuffNow provides the ability to import your contacts from Outlook or Gmail into its service so you can upload a file and select recipients with ease.<br /><br />iPHONE/iPad/iPod App:  The iPhone and iPad app allows users to manage files and account without a computer. You can view files, send invitations, change expiration dates, or revoke all privileges for a file and make it private again. One additional nice feature is that you can also upload photos and videos from your iPhone/iPad/iPod and share them remotely...again without a computer.<br /><br />I love the product and would give it 5 stars.  However, the 2gb of storage space and the 40gb monthly limit at this level is somewhat of a deal breaker.  You have to get to the next level to gain more storage and  transfer limits..(msrp is $180 / year for 80gb of transfer and 8gb of storage).  Quite expensive in todays date as there are competitors that offer better pricing with unlimited transfers.<br /><br />Everything about SendStuffNow is great, except pricing and that unfortunately makes it lose 1 star.  4/5 for me...ite expensive in todays date as there are competitors that offer better pricing with unlimited transfers.

I have been a Warhammer 40,000 fan since the mid-90's where I picked up two boxes of Space Marine, a box of Cadian Shock Troop, and a box of Catachan Jungle Fighter miniatures in an attempt to build a small wargaming diorama. I had a few friends that played the table-top wargame and had been watching them play for quite some time and decided to give it a try (as my D&D group was rapidly dissolving). For a number of years I had a wonderfully maintained Tau army that I would play with, but eventually moved away from the wargaming due to rising costs.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years and Relic releases Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War and I am immediately on board for some excellent RTS action. Over the last two decades we have seen numerous Warhammer games come and go, some being excellent (the Dawn of War games), and some being terrible (any MMO in the Warhammer universe) and those fans out there like me have been itching to get back into the strategic combat found in the Dawn of War series have been very unlucky as nothing good has really surfaced. Enter in Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon, a turn-based strategy title taking place in the massive Warhammer 40,000 universe where you will have your pick of hundreds of units to do battle against the Xenos.<br /><br />I have been waiting for a tried-and-true Warhammer 40,000 turn-based strategy game for years, something that sticks to the Warhammer 40,000 tabeltop wargaming rules. Unfortunately Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon is not that game. It looks, feels, and acts nearly identical to one of the other titles developed by Flashback Games/The Lordz Game Studio (Panzer Corps). From the graphics to the sound to the way it plays, this feels like a reskin of Panzer Corps. While not a terrible game it is certainly not one that is truly worthy of the Warhammer 40,000 license.<br /><br />Take the graphics for example, rather than rich and detailed models for the different units, you have very simple, basic, and detail-free 2D sprites that all have one thing in common; brown. In addition to the lackluster unit details and colors the different &#34;levels&#34; or boards are plain, uninteresting, and contain yet another color in common; brown. When looking over the playing area it is very easy to see that Armageddon would fare far better on a tablet than on a PC. Lackluster graphics, simplistic and very plain explosions and effects, all seem much more suited to the low-power tablets than a gaming machine and the game plays in the same fashion as well.<br /><br />In addition to sub-par graphics the audio is tinny, flat, and has no real depth and feel like they would be far more suited to a single-speaker tablet. Listening through my Kingston HyperX Cloud headset is a shame, since everything just sounds low quality where it should be rich and detailed. Weapon shots and explosions have no real variation and the audio sounds like it pulls from a small selection of recycled sounds; not what I was expecting. The music is not terrible, with decent scores, but it just sounds hollow compared to some of the other turn-based strategy games that I have been played where they were designed solely for the PC rather than for tablets and PCs. Unfortunately the effect is jarring and I found myself firing up Spotify or Crunchyroll just to have some background audio that was interesting.<br /><br />Gameplay is fairly simple and straightforward; you have a map that is overlaid with a hex-grid. Your units move across these hexes and can attack adjacent hexes, or in some cases, a few hexes away. Mountainous regions, forests, and other types of terrain have bonuses and allow for choke points, but there is no real depth to the strategy. More often than not I would stagger infantry-type units with armor-type units and then turtle my way across a map; a simple strategy like this tends to guarantee victory so there is very little challenge to the game. If anything, the biggest plus to the game is the sheer amount of units that are actually available in game, though there were plenty that I never used or encountered, which is sad because a turn-based Warhammer 40K game could be excellent; unfortunately Armageddon is mediocre at best.<br /><br />While it is not the worst Warhammer title I have played, Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon is definitely not the best. Plain graphics, simple scenarios and combat missions, sub-par AI and low-quality audio all wrap up to provide a game that simply &#34;is.&#34; The biggest downfall is in the feel that this is simply a reskin of a different title, which in itself was not a terrible game, just not a great game. Being the longtime fan of the Warhammer franchise I feel a bit confused and befuddled by Armageddon and more than a little let down. What could have been a great game is only so-so, as if it were an attempt to capitalize on my desire to play a Warhammer game, given it has been quite some time since anything of quality has come out. However, the game is not without its merits, being a generally fast turn-based strategy game with a massive pile of units at your disposal, Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon is a title more suited for tablets as the PC port is far from perfect.t are actually available in game, though there were plenty that I never used or encountered, which is sad because a turn-based Warhammer 40K game could be excellent; unfortunately Armageddon is mediocre at best.<br /><br />While it is not the worst Warhammer title I have played, Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon is definitely not the best.

Learn Estonian	Software	3	1	1	N	Y	Not the best interface	So...EuroTalk seems to have hired some really great native speakers to record the lessons in this CD, but they probably used most of their budget on the voice actors and had to skimp on the UI.  Because, wow.  It's really unfortunate.  Like a second-thought, spare tire kind of unfortunate.<br /><br />Apart from the interface, the actual language instruction is pretty good.  I learned enough to have a very basic conversation, mostly focusing on shouting vocabulary at my Estonian friends without bothering to conjugate anything.  But since the interface is an important part of the language bit, I'm only giving this three stars.  Also, I could not, for the life of me, get the iPod version to load into iTunes correctly.	2013-03-21

I got it at a bargain price during an Amazon \\"Deal of the Day\\" sale.  I must say that the \\"Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate & VideoStudio Pro X2 Bundle\\" is well worth the price and more. I am a casual user of photo editing software, having used Photo Impression, Photosmart, Adobe Photoshop Elements 6, and a few freeware editors since about 1998.  So I know a little about them.  My experience with this product tells me that it has features that range from simple to use, to useful only by demanding professionals. If you are a point and shoot photographer, this product will come in handy to quickly fix your less than perfect photos or enhance your great shots to suit your needs.  One drawback, in my opinion is the lack of photo distortion toys that Adobe Elements possessed to turn your picture into artwork.  But, curiously, this feature is available on the VideoStudio 12 editor that comes bundled with this product.  The video editor is simple to use, yet has features that can get quite complicated for those who want to turn out something more professional and extraordinary looking.  I gave it a 4-star rating because it takes longer to do a photo editing project than Adobe, and because many of the features from past editions are missing.  But, all in all it's a fine product that does what most people would want from a quality photo editor.	2009-07-04

X for Mac [Old Version]	Software	4	14	15	N	N	The best product for the task, too bad it's MS	First, I'd like to clarify a common misconception that was mentioned in a previous review. The reviewer did not like any version of Office produced after Office 98, because he said his familiar Excel shortcut keys are no longer available. This isn't exactly true. In Office 2001, the shortcut keys that used the command key (a.k.a. the apple key) now use the control key instead. When many people try out the new version, they notice that &quot;apple-k,&quot; for example, no longer did what it used to. A little more investigation would reveal that you can still perform all of the shortcut functions you used to. Any that no longer use the command key now use the control key, that's all.<BR>Furthermore, in Office X, you can now set all of the shortcut keys back to how they were in Office 98, if you want.<BR>Now on to the review of Office X:<BR>I use Office all day, every day for email, process document authoring, data analysis, training presentations, and more. Mainly, I use Entourage and Excel. I spend hours a day in each. Overall, I think Office for the Mac is the best thing to ever come from Microsoft. The Si Valley-based MS Mac Business Unit is as far removed from MS as an entire division can be, though, and this is why Office X can be cool. Here's what I like and dislike about Office X:<BR>Likes:<BR>-  No other spreadsheet application can drill down, simplify, manipulate, and automate complex data analysis like Excel. If you take the time to learn the ins and outs of Excel, you'll also learn just what all you can do with a list of data and the many patterns in the information you have. You will learn to demand more from your information -- and from Excel, and Excel can rise to that occasion.<BR>- Excel documents will now autosave!!! <BR>- Redundent tasks can be scripted using AppleScript, VisualBasic, or RealBasic.<BR>- Entourage rocks. I receive 500+ emails a day, and they are easily managed and automated. They are automatically filtered when received -- they're automatically received. All the administration of email is taken care of so that I can concentrate on the messages themselves, and since my mail is filtered for me, I know which messages require more concentration and which can wait. Entourage remembers if you have ever sent or received an email from a certain email address or person, and as soon as you type a recipient's name in a message, it will give you a list of potential recipients, based on the characters you have entered so far. I don't use the other personal assistant features, so I can't comment on those.<BR>- Word is the most powerful word processing tool that I have used. Sure, there's a learning curve, but if you want to do something that you don't know how to do, usually you can poke around and figure out how to accomplish it in not too much time.<BR>- PowerPoint is great for presentations. Also, in the Mac version, you can save your preso as a Quicktime movie, which can be streamed on the Web, put on DVD, etc.<BR>- Full, two-way compatibility with Wintel platforms.<BR>- Bug fixes taken care of from the previous version.<BR>- new Aqua interface, improvements to look and operation of Entourage. <BR>- CARBONIZED!!! I don't have to run Office in Classic any more!<BR>- Collaborative tools allow for multiple users working on a single document<br />Dislikes are below<BR>-It's a MS product. No matter how cool the MS Mac Business Unit is, they're still MS.<BR>- There are still a few bugs to iron out. I've made Excel crash twice so far. Of course, it had been up and running for probably a week or two.<BR>- It seems a little slower.<BR>- Steep learning curve for novices.<BR>- Expensive (I get my money's worth, but others may find the price high for what they do)<BR>- No foreign language grammar check. I compose some documents in French, and I'm not a native speeker. There's French spellcheck, but French grammar check would be awesome.<br />That's about all I have to say. If you're near an Apple retail store, all ofthe computers there are loaded with Office for X. Go try it out and see what you think for yourself.	2001-12-16

Aside from its accuracy and, at least as far as I know, its completeness, the thing I like most about Turbo Tax is that I can work on my taxes at my own pace and convenience. You have to do most of the same work anyway if you gather up and organize your records for a professional tax preparer, so why not do the data entry yourself and save time and money? The professionals use a version of the same software, so your aren't giving up anything of substance. If you're still unsure, have your taxes done by a professional one year, then borrow a copy of Turbo Tax from a friend and follow its instructions with the same data. See how the results compare, and if they're the same, try TT the next year by yourself. Be sure to buy the version that covers your situation. An easy check list on the boxes will guide you.	2013-03-24

If you have never used Adobe Photoshop Elements and/or have been currently using another image editing program such as LightZone like this reviewer, supplementary programs like the online tutorials, the printed manual (and even more than the company provides) might be needed to take full advantage of the program without as much time learning the program through trial and error.  This program is not completely plug and play so do not expect miracles overnight but with increased usage and familiarity, the program becomes more and more indispensable.  Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 is an excellent choice for image editing for a wide range of photographers.<br /><br />Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 is split between organizing and editing from the outset welcome screen.  Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 has several tools to help photographers organize and manage large quantities of photographs: People Recognition tool to find specific people, tag application, and auto-analyzer tag and 2GB of free online backup storage are free with the program.  Perhaps the organizational tool would be useful for users with lots of vacation or family photographs or for photographers who do not have their own organizational method already in use. As someone who takes few portraits or vacation photos and who already has my own organization, I found this aspect of the program more of a bother.<br /><br />In image editing, a quick control menu for those wanting basic controls is easily and quickly accessible allowing control of Lighting (Shadow, Midtone and Highlight control), Color (saturation and Hue), Balance (temperature and tint) and sharpness.<br /><br />Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 has guided edits which help newer users explore a wider range of image editing.  Under guided edits, the following options exist:<br />1. Under Basic Edits: crop, recompose (with option of removing clutter with protect and remove brush), rotate/straighten, sharpen.<br />2. Under Lighting and Exposure: Lighten or Darken with separate controls for shadows, highlights and midtones, Brightness and Contrast,  Adjust levels using histogram to fine tune shadows, midtones and highlights.<br />3. Under Color Correction: Enhance colors (hue, saturation, color lightness), Correct Color Cast which corrects tone of light source using an eyedropper on area that should be white, grey or black, Adjust skin tone to adjust tan, blush (reds), and ambient light.<br />4. Under Guided Activities: Touch up Scratches and Blemishes (uses a small or larger healing brush), Crop and Recompose again, and Fix Keystone Distortion with separate horizontal and vertical, and other finer controls.<br />5. Other items: Photo merge (Group shot, Faces, Scene Cleaner, Exposure, Style Match)<br />Action Player (allows one to certain effects such as create borders, sepia toning, sepia toning with grain, faded ink with vignette)<br />Line Drawing, Old Fashioned Photo, Saturated Slide Film Effect to enhance colors, Lomo Camera Effect, Out of Bounds (so part of image seems to come out of frame), Perfect Portrait (skin blurring, red eye correction, brighten eyes, burn tool for eyelashes, whiten teeth, add glow),  Pop Art (black and one color x 4), Create Reflection.<br /><br />Adobe Photoshop Elements is a perfect choice for the photographer who wants to do some corrections in image editing while still wanting to maintain the photography element of their work (versus some of the more extensive image manipulation available).  Some of the effects (like Pop Art) are for pure fun and will only appeal to a small audience once the novelty wears off.  Unfortunately, some of the fun links under share are more an advertisement for Premiere Elements 9 Plus for a plus price.  Others such as the correction of flaws and blemishes and the correction of keystone distortion are more useful to other users like myself.  The keystone distortion fix for converging architectural lines is simply fantastic for urban photographers like myself who photograph a lot of buildings.<br /><br />Users of LightZone will appreciate having finer controls on more aspects of the image or find many of the same controls available, albeit sometimes under a differently presented menu.  The changeover to this software has not always been easy.  Just figuring out how to scroll through a 1:1 image was not intuitive (use hand tool on left on screen).  I miss being able to preset the save function to a specific function (like Tiff files).  The one item I find most lacking is in the sharpen tool.  Lightzone's Clarity Function (a Sharpen tool with a few other preset algorithms) allows texture to really pop in a way I have not been able to duplicate in Photoshop Elements 9. Personally, I find it easier to correct flaws and blemishes with Lightzone but perhaps with more Elements experience, the two will be relatively equal.  Fortunately, Photoshop Elements 9 allows me to work on images edited in another program so I can have the best of 2 worlds.<br /><br />I highly recommend PhotoShop Elements 9 to avid photographers from those who like to snap family and vacation pictures but who want more control over the image afterwards to the artist photographer like myself who want more control over the image but who do not have need of the extensive digital manipulation of  photography which is now closer to computer imaging than photography.  For my personal needs, the correction of keystone distortion, the correction of flaws and blemishes and the finer image editing controls is reason enough to make this product worth buying in addition to my current program.<br /><br />Rating this product with a number is difficult.  For the elements I need most, the product is worth 5 stars plus --- it's terrific.  As a whole it has a lot of elements I do not need which clutter the program but make it appeal to a wider audience.  As a whole, I would rate the product as very good for a general audience, with parts of the program clearly exceptional and well worth the purchase of the product.nks under share are more an advertisement for Premiere Elements 9 Plus for a plus price.

This program, however, is one of her favorite sit down activities in the world right now - which is saying a lot. Her favorite activities in the program are the pattern and matching games, and she definitely prefers to play in the `hard' rather than `easy' range. The cool thing about that, though, is that the easy range is just about the level needed for her 2 ½ year old sister, which allows both of them to enjoy activities and be appropriately challenged. They both really like music so the memory music section is a big hit. It's got some critical thinking/problem solving activities and lots of work with numbers, letters, shapes and colors making it a terrific support to what is being learned in preschool.        *This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User Community (NDUC).

US	52660768	R24386ZP7CUJ1R	B004TKTOWC	786938154	Corel PDF Fusion	Software	3	0	0	Y	N	You get what you pay for	Since a full version of Adobe Acrobat is so expensive, a lot of people look for a cheaper alternative to creating, editing and assembling PDF files. On first glance, Corel PDF Fusion seems like it may be one of those alternate products.  It comes from a respected name in the industry so I would tend to trust it more than some free or really cheap solution I found on the internet by doing a Google search.<br /><br />That said, if you read the product description you will find that the major purpose of this software (and it is in the name, too) is to assemble a PDF document from multiple file/software formats into a combined, integrated document. There are limited abilities to edit, crop, make modifications to the content, etc. But the main thing is it is to fuse several different source documents into one PDF file.<br /><br />The product installed easily enough. In terms of does it do what it is supposed to do?  Well, for basic tasks it does fine although personally I think the interface is a bit confusing. If you want to do any detailed editing or modifications, this product doesn't do that very well and I don't think that is what it is supposed to do. But what can you expect from something that is priced about 1/10 of Adobe Acrobat?  Even less now, since the price has been pretty heavily discounted by Amazon.  You get what you pay for. If you really want creation and editing capabilities and a real ability to work with a PDF file you will have to bite the bullet and pay the money for Acrobat. I have a full version of Acrobat and there is just no comparison. Of course it costs a lot more money but that's why there is a difference in cost, because not only of the capabilities, but of the results. It's like how I've found when it comes to replacing an HP inkjet cartridge, compatibles just don't cut it - you have to get the HP OEM cartridge for it to work properly.<br /><br />Fusion does a decent job of assembling PDF documents and if that is really all you need, thenthis will do the trick. Anything more and you should be aware you may be expecting too much.	2012-05-14

First of all, there is no DVORAK capability. (For those who don't know what this is, this the keyboard that has more efficient placement of keys for faster typing. The old QWERTY keyboard was developed to SLOW down typist who constantly jammed mechanical keyboards. This does not apply to us anymore with electronic keyboards, and hence, should no longer be taught in typing classes). <br />Secondly, with the first Quickverse (for Windows 3.1) it was very easy finding verses, texts and Strong meanings all at one time. It was really easy and fun. I expected enhancements in this version, but found everything now is topsy-turvy, confusing and inefficient. It's a pain now to go to different menus, check boxes and windows for every little verse, text, search, books and Strong word meanings.  Part of the search box even blocks off the titles of the books you need to search making it difficult to choose quickly.  Simply put, this version of Quick Verse is not fast to use anymore and downright annoying, and to top it off I have to peck my keyboard with one finger since there is no DVORAK conversion.  You will also be doing a lot of switching to different windows as this version seems to put every different thing into a window.<br />There is no warning on the box that it is not DVORAK capable.<BR>I might add that this version, of course, adds more books too and may explain some of the complication.  Still, there is need to change the basics of how it should work.	2002-10-01

I'm very glad that I did.  This product has done everything that I hoped it would, and more.  Since I've retired and begun withdrawls on my investments, I've wanted to simplify the tracking of my financial accounts.  With Premier 2007 it's been very easy to download all of my financial transactions and eliminate almost all of the manual entries that I previously had to do.  Other features, such as financial analysis, graphing, etc, have also worked well and been very useful.  Of course, the general program functioning is just as good as I've come to expect based on other Quicken programs I've owned.  My only problem (and I'm a long way from having tried all the program features) is that I can't set up the calendar with repeat payment due dates as a \\"reference only\\" tool, because without having set up bill payment through Quicken Bill Pay these calendar entries are seen as unpaid bills, which is then negatively reflected in my cash flow.  This problem aside, I can highly recommend Quicken Premier 2007.	2006-11-05

It is way too complicated.  It would have been much better just to have a FILE section where you access your own computer's directories and import from there without all the other choices.  It tales me a while to figure out how to get top my directories each time.  The exporting is OK as you can send the photos back to the directory you want - LR does put them in a sub-directory of your directory labeled UNTITLED EXPORT but is easy to find and work from.<br /><br />I really do like the two separate BLACK and WHITE buttons as it is much easier to get the contrast I want in a photo than it is possible to with a CONTRAST button which does both at the same time. The noise reduction section also works better than my ELEMENT VI PHOTO SHOP's.  I am hoping I will like it better after I have worked with it for a while and learned more about it's features.	2014-06-04

I use internet security software as insurance for those times when I inadvertantly click on a malicious website, but I was getting very frustraited with the length of time my internet security software was consuming for updates and full scans. It seemed like that software was always in the way of what I needed to do on my laptop. Anyway, I recently purchased a new laptop and the vendor supplied a free one year trial of Kaspersky Internet security. Updates and scans were much faster on my new laptop (but maybe was that because of the faster chip?). I decided to purchase a 3 user package of Kaspersky for the three other laptops we have (including the one I just replaced - now my backup). Turns out it wasn't just the faster chip in my new laptop. Kaspersky can scan the entire hard drive in my old laptop in about half the time as my old security software.  If I had known this, I might have held off another year before replacing my old laptop. The purchase price through Amazon was a bargain. With my old securtiy software, I was renewing anually and every year the price was increasing. Glad I made the switch and glad I got the software through Amazon.  I paid less for 3 licenses of Kaspersky than I did for one license with my old software. By the way...installation has been a snap (and I've done this on several computers now without a hitch). I use windows to remove the old software first but apparantly some pieces still remain. Each time Kaspersky removed the remaining pieces of my old security software as part of its installation routine.  Thank you Kaspersky and Amazon.	2012-06-04

It is only available while supplies last, so if you're planning on installing on multiple machines or think you may have use for more upgrade licenses in the future it would be prudent to get the 3-pack.  Also, I'm running the 64-bit version on an Intel Core 2 Duo e7300 @ 2.66GHz with 4GB DDR3 cheapo RAM and an old Nvidia 6800GT    Just this to say before I get into the new and improved Windows: I consider OSX: Snow Leopard to be the superior OS in terms of design and functionality, but Microsoft has really gotten closer to the OSX experience and in some areas have even surpassed it.  For a multitude of reasons, people need to use Windows-based systems (business, gaming, cheaper hardware, more software, personal preference, etc.)  I am one of those users and generally feel more \\"at home\\" on the Windows platform.  It's nice to finally have a Windows OS that is fast, fun, stable, functional, and good looking.    I'm not going to do a full blow-by-blow as others have already done it.  What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with.  I've been a long-time XP holdout, but once I gave the release candidate a spin a couple weeks ago there was no looking back since Windows 7 has truly exceeded my expectations.  Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional (or non-functional) without much pizazz or many \\"power user\\" shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well-crafted OS.    (+) Search is awesome.  Very robust and extremely fast, I can find and open programs or files by just hitting \\"window\\" on the keyboard (which opens the start menu) and typing in the first few letters of the thing I want to open and Win7 almost instantaneously finds what I'm looking for.  Search was basically useless in XP, but it is now one ofthe things I use most in Windows 7.  Good stuff!    (+) Improved taskbar, which in some ways is better and more organized than the OSX Dock.  It may take some getting used to if you are coming from XP, but give the new taskbar a chance and you'll see that the grouped, two-tier app -> window system keeps things a lot tidier, especially if you're the type of user that likes to have 6+ windows open at a time.  One tip: I've still found a need for the quicklaunch toolbar since I still find direct folder shortcuts useful... and you can't \\"pin\\" folders directly onto the new taskbar.    (+) Since the GPU is utilized for many of the graphic intensive aero transitions, clicking around and maneuvering in the new OS is smooth and snazzy.  Everything happens snappily and looks pretty slick, and the user-interface is quite intuitive.  The new \\"windows key + tab\\" 3D window selector is pretty nice.  Win7 looks great and feels fast... faster than XP in many areas on my system.    (+) The built-in software firewall in Win7 is much more robust and customizable than in XP SP2/3.  In fact, the Win7 firewall is probably suitable enough to make cheap software firewall solutions like ZoneAlarms Free and Comodo Firewall unnecessary and redundant.  This allows the end-user to save on system resources and boot times.    Color me impressed by this effort from Microsoft.  I didn't think they had it in them, but they put together one very nice OS.  It's great that they are starting to feel the pressure from Apple and Linux, because it means they will have to continue to evolve and make things better or suffer the consequences.  In the end, this competition amongst the developers is a win for the end user... and Windows 7 shows that Microsoft IS actually capable of good work when they really apply themselves.	2009-10-25

There is a learning curve with regards to the original setup for the field names and columns names to fit the user's choices vs. the default setup. In my case the best feature of this application is the ability to import an existing database. I have nearly 1,000 items in the 20 year old program I am currently using, and none of the home inventory programs I have tried do not provide any method of importing an existing database. I have no desire to re-enter every item, and all of the details of each item of my current database into a new program.<br /><br />The best part of this program is that you can import any existing database via a spreadsheet created from an exported file of your existing program. My current program exports all data to a .txt file which in turn can be converted by MS Excel to a comma delimited spreadsheet. I saved the spreadsheet as a .txt file, a .csv file, and as an .xls file. This program can import access (.mdb), excel (.xls), and comma delimited text (.csv) files. I tried the .xls file first which worked fine with one exception. The serial number field appears to be formatted as a number only field and when imported would only show serial numbers that did not have any alpha characters in the serial number. So I emailed tech support and I received a reply the next day advising I should try using the .csv file spreadsheet as the import rather than the .xls file. I did as they said and the import worked great, including all of the serial numbers.<br /><br />This import feature alone is worth the price of this application in my opinion. As the other reviewer wrote, yes there are some bugs, but nothing that I was not able to deal with, and did not cause any problems to the program as a whole. The only thing I have not tried and can not comment on would be the backup and restore process which saves the database in a \\"zip\\" file. So based on the low price, and the great import feature, I feel this program deserves 5 stars, but reduced by 1 because of the bugs.m deserves 5 stars, but reduced by 1 because of the bugs.	2010-10-06

I have been using Mastercook for a loooong time to manage my recipe files: I have been using MC4 and all my files were stored in it.  In general, I loved it and it did everything I needed from a recipe manager, but my old version was getting really buggy.  I have been waiting for an update that was reported to work well with Vista and would easily accept files from older versions and this is it.  I just installed the program and indicated where my old cookbooks were stored and it loaded them right in. So far, it has worked with the old files seamlessly.<br />  I also love the functionalities of this version which, admittedly, may not be new to Mastercook, but are new to me.  Among these are the ability to make a menu and cost out the entire thing.  I do some catering and this has been a super tool to estimate per person costs of jobs.  Of course, you still have to enter ingredient costs manually, but once that's done, it's there when you need it.<br />  The reason I only gave it four stars are some quirks of navigation between individual recipes and the cookbook &#34;indices&#34; and the vagueness of the description of some of the standard ingredients.  However, you can always just make your own ingredient description, so this does not detract too much.  I also used to be able to upload plain text files with special formatting right into the program, making it easy to cut a recipe from a web page, paste it into a Word doc and then save it in the proper plain text format. Now it appears that you have to cut and paste the ingredients and directions one at a time from the web page, making it more time-consuming.<br />  Overall, I am thrilled with this version of Mastercook and would recommend it to anyone looking for a way to store your piles of precious paper recipes.	2012-12-20

In the conversion from .mac to Mobile Me, all of my contacts were lost. Five years worth. Of course, Apple Support told me it was my fault. (Never mind that I was paying them to keep my data safe on their servers, with promises from them of stability). The consolation? Three free months of Mobile Me, a crappy service at a $25 value. That will not even pay for the first 30 minutes of my time trying to gather all of my contacts back.     I have used macs and apple-related products exclusively for several years. I was a convert from Windows to Apple. Now, I am more discriminate in my selection of technology-related products and understand that Apple is more style over substance.

The software seems a rough around the edges, (the speakers mouths don't match what the audio clearly pronounces), but I think if you can find this product on the cheaper side, it might be worth it. There are games to help you get a hang of learning the language; they mostly say the words, so it puts the responsibility a little more on the user to get the most out of it. The vocabulary lists are helpful for learning new words/phrases. I wish it had voice recognition software to say whether or not you are pronouncing correctly since Chinese is a tonal language, but if you want, you can record yourself saying the word and then compare it to the speaker's voice.  Overall, the product isn't the prettiest (the graphics are a little poor), but can be a good deal if you're willing to work a little.

They call this an upgrade?<br /><br />For starters, this version is incredibly slooooooow. And I mean slooooow. It is slow to launch, and slower to close. Recognition is even slower. The promotional material stated that it was &#34;20% more accurate,&#34; but I have yet to discover this unique aspect of this upgrade. The previous version (11.5) is far, far superior and much faster, compared to this clunky dog. And in typical Dragon fashion, technical support is a big run around, especially when you're calling to complain about the new upgrade. No one seems to know anything.<br /><br />I've found that it no longer allows me direct access to dictate my godaddy webmail; now the dictation box pops up. Not a huge deal, but annoying. There are several other applications that duplicate this process, where in the past, it was just simple dictation to various fields.<br /><br />My upgrade wouldn't allow me to import my user profiles from 11.5, so I had to start from scratch with a new user profile. More time wasted.<br /><br />That being said: Dragon is still the leader in speech to text technology (IMO). I'm just surprised that they released this inferior upgrade and called it an &#34;improvement&#34; on previous versions. Purchasers should be well advised to consider an earlier version of the program . . . at least until all of the bugs are worked out of premium 12. Until then, I'm going to dump it an re-install 11.5.<br /><br />Buyer beware.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/03/13:<br /><br />I continue to use version 12, (I have not went back to 11.5, as I stated I would do) and I stand by my above review. Version 12 is very slow to load and often maddingly slow to close. I was hoping that consistent working with the program, including audio training, would improve accuracy. To an extent, it does, but the strange quirks of this &#34;upgrade&#34; just don't make any sense. Often, Dragon takes nearly a full minute to boot up, and when you perform user maintenance to your profile when closing the program, it's not uncommon for this process to take two minutes or more. I might note here that I am using Windows 7 64 bit with 8GB RAM and plenty of space on the hard drive, so there shouldn't be any space/speed issues. I think Dragon rushed this one out, and I hope they make some serious improvements with future upgrades.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/06/13:<br /><br />I am closing out Dragon 12, and the program is performing its 'User Profile Mainenance.' So far, it has taken over 4 minutes, and the status bar doesn't even read 50%. This is ridiculous, compared with earlier versions of the program.<br /><br />On another note: those of you using Dragon for their iPhone will be pleasantly surprised that the new update they released just a few days ago does nothing but CRASH! Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program twice; no luck. Sure, it's free, but Nuance seems to be intentionally driving away customers. There are newly-emerging companies that are competing in this field of limited players, and this loyal customer (until recently) is happy to explore other options. I now see they've lowered the price for Dragon 12 Premium (again), so maybe they figured out that their most recent releases weren't quite ready for prime time. Do yourself a favor and pick up vers. 11.5. I've learned my lesson, and am dumping 12 in favor of an older, better version. And I mean it, this time.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/06/13:<br /><br />As suspected, 11.5 (the previous version) is an upgrade from their &#34;upgrade.&#34; Much faster to load and close, speech recognition is (IMO) better than 12. I can't wait for their customer service folks to call me with a 'special deal' when they release their next upgrade. I will demand a refund for vers. 12 before I purchase their latest &#34;upgrade.&#34;<br /><br />One other note that I would add to those considering purchasing vers. 12:When you are dictating in a text box (as I had to do for my e-mail when using vers. 12), there is a good chance that you will LOSE what you are dictating if you do not transfer your paragraphs piece by piece. Numerous times, I'd compose lengthy emails, transfer them, only to have them vanish. VERY FRUSTRATING AND A WASTE OF OUR TIME, NUANCE. When I went back to vers. 11.5, it allows me to dictate directly to the compose window. Much more efficient.<br /><br />On a positive note: Dragon recently updated their iPhone app, and (surprise!) this one actually WORKS!<br /><br />UPDATE 2/1/16<br /><br />STAY AWAY. STAY COMPLETELY AWAY FROM DRAGON. Although speech-to-text is wonderful technology, my experience with Dragon has been miserable, ever since my 'upgrade' to 12. My most recent venture was an upgrade to a new Dell computer with Windows 10. Dragon crashes within the first few minutes after bootup, every time. On my desktop computer, I play 'Dragon Bingo,' as I don't know what program it's going to decide to be incompatible with. Sometimes it works with Word, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it works with WordPerfect, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it works with Libre Office, sometimes it doesn't. After all these years, Dragon should just hang it up. The speech to text program that comes with Windows is, at the very least, solid. Before spending the money on Dragon, you should really ask yourself: &#34;Do I enjoy sharp, heavy objects rammed into my ears at high speed?&#34; Because that's what it's going to feel like after you install this program. I might add that their 12.5 'disservice pack' as I call it will cause your hard drive to projectile vomit. STAY AWAY.E what you are dictating if you do not transfer your paragraphs piece by piece.

I do not like the fact that Microsoft pushes users more and more towards Bing.  I do not like the fact that you are seemingly pushed into having a Microsoft email to sync all of the content (even though you can use other email accounts).  I do not like having to search for every program through the Search function.  I miss having my Windows XP/7 desktop and Start button.  There are ways around all of these issues, but it is a pain and a huge learning curve... I feel for those who are not as tech savvy.  This OS is simply not very intuitive and is more like a flashing billboard advertisement for Microsoft.  I'm also experiencing IE crashes and power management problems since upgrade, so I have concerns over the stability.	2014-01-11

I don't think there's a more infuriating company to deal with than Microsoft - I've had worse luck with Microsoft than Comcast, and I'd go so far as to say my experience with Microsoft rivals that of the DMV.<br /><br />Every version of Windows just seems to be worse than the last.  I wish I didn't have to use Windows, but alas most of the games I play will only run properly on Windows machines and so I am forced into Microsoft's lap.<br /><br />Here's a great example of a typical experience I have with Microsoft products, as recently experienced with my new purchase of Windows 8.1 Pro.<br /><br />I purchased Windows 8.1 on 1/7, and proceeded to attempt to install it.  For some reason, Windows would not install. I called Microsoft and spent 5 minutes going through a series of automated questions via a telephone audio prompt only to find out they were closed.<br /><br />At work the next day, I call up Microsoft (and go through the world's most annoying audio prompts yet again) to ask if they will be open when I get home that evening.  The customer service rep responds that they are open 24 hours a day.  Fantastic, I'll call later!  I call at 8:35 and go through 25 minutes of &#34;Technical Support&#34; (In other words, them asking me to make sure my cables are all plugged in, and to reboot the computers -- gee, thanks), only to be transferred to a Tier 2 agent.  All of a sudden, the call goes dead - I lose the agent.  I call back, no answer.  They're closed.  What?  I just called today and they assured me they'd be open.  Great, I guess I'll wait another day to try to install my OS.<br /><br />The next day, I make sure I'm home from work very early so I can get a head start and call Tech Support.  After the same nonsense where I'm asked to try to reinstall Windows for the 5th time even though I assure them I've already gone through this several times, I'm told that they will have to call me back the next day to fix this issue.  Are you serious?<br /><br />Fed up with this whole nightmare, I worked for 7 hours straight and finally got my computer into a manageable state.  I had to go through so many hoops in those 7 hours that are so typical of my past Microsoft Windows experiences.  I can think of more times when I've had terrible PC meltdowns like this than I care to remember.  It always involves countless hours of research on Google, messing about with the BIOS, reformatting, or going to other great lengths just to get an operating system setup.  The only reason I deal with this is because there's no other option.  For my work computer, I use an Apple and I never have had to deal with nonsense like this.<br /><br />And what frustrates me even more is that I couldn't even get help with this issue.  I'd go through 10 menus of an automated voice activated phone system just to reach the Windows Technical Support Team, only to find out that I wasn't actually in the Windows Tech Support phone line and had to be transferred.<br /><br />Windows is probably some of the worst software I've ever used in my entire life, and the &#34;support&#34; you get from Microsoft is basically non-existent.  I only recommend this product if you literally have no other option.  It's a waste of time, money, and energy.  Hopefully this message gets through to someone high enough in the Microsoft bureaucracy to actually do something about it.this whole nightmare, I worked for 7 hours straight and finally got my computer into a manageable state.

US	49497718	R26ZV8RGSTNXDD	B00GWH3CK0	319697924	FileMaker 13 Pro ESD	Software	5	1	1	Y	N	So long Excel	I have a small company.  That means I have a mailing list that includes names numbering in the tens of thousands.  Of necessity, I've used Excel for quite a while.  It's undoubtedly a powerful program and is probably able to do many of the things I'd like to do.  But to say that Excel is obtuse would be understating it.  I tried using Numbers, but found it unstable with a database this size.  I dug through Excel at some length, trying to learn what I needed to learn.  But as with many things Microsoft, you'd need to take a course or purchase a wheelbarrow full of books, and that just rubs me the wrong way (especially since I've spent decades as a programmer).  In the end, I've ended up writing my own programs to manipulate the data in the ways I needed.<br /><br />Then along comes FileMaker. It's been around for ages, but I never thought to try it before.  In just a few hours of playing around, I had it doing most of the things I could never do in Excel.  I could view and arrange data in meaningful ways that will allow me to glean more useful information from my customer data.  Sure, I looked at the Filemaker tutorials (meager) and at the Filemaker Forum (most helpful).  But I'd spend hours digging through Excel sites and never managed to do more than basic stuff with it.<br /><br />I've found that it's quite a simple matter to update my database files from csv files (normally the way I receive much of my data).  There are many ways to massage the data before bringing it in.  I can also easily export csv (as well as many other formats) for other external processing.  I should also say that it's quite fast--faster than Excel for what I'm doing.  Sorts are completed almost as soon as they're begun.  It's also been quite stable during the time I've been testing.<br /><br />It's not perfect.  When exporting to csv, Filemaker won't let you export column headers as the first row of text.  That's an oversight that needs correcting, since it's a very common practice in csv.  You can still do it in a roundabout way by exporting to Excel and then saving as csv.  But I'm looking forward to forgetting where Excel is on my computer.  There are a few operations that are less-intuitive than they might be.  But--unlike Excel--I could find my way through these issues quickly.<br /><br />There are many aspects of Filemaker that I won't be able to try until my company grows.  The ability to have shared access to a database from different computers is a big plus, but would be worth intensive testing before committing. But I'm looking forward to experimenting with the different ways I can view and present my data.  Unlike that &#34;other program&#34;, Filemaker actually makes you want to play.You can still do it in a roundabout way by exporting to Excel and then saving as csv.

My wife and I run a consulting firm and the fact that Quickbooks has a consulting firm set-up feature sold me on it. We do not need to track sales or inventory, and Quickbooks was able to make that distinction and set up our business just the way it needed to be. The Business Walkthrough is a great feature and made setting up shop very simple.    I was a little intimidated in the beginning, since I have little accounting experience. But I printed out and read the section on Consulting from the help document and everything became more clear to me. Now that I have a better grasp of the features I am much more comfortable with the program. It reminds me a lot of Quicken I use for personal finance, which helps with the comfort factor.     I downloaded the Trial first, and was able to perform all functions and even set up the company. I wanted to see if it would afford everything I needed, and it did. I would recommend people try it first, to see if it gives you everything you are looking for.    My only complaint is the update pricing, or lack there of. Intuit should offer discounts to it's loyal customers.    I would recommend this program to anyone in the consulting field due to the defined business model it can spit out. I like not having all the extra accounts and expenses I don't need to track.	2008-03-01

It supports almost any compression type you can imagine, as well as adding its own compression format, however the support is very buggy.<br />The main problems with this are speed and errors. First, this product is at least 10 times slower than the command-line based extraction tools, and at least 5 times slower than any other graphical archiving tool I've used.<br />Second, there are many errors in this product. For example, I've had several zip files and rar files fail to decompress. The product reports an error about the file format being wrong, or it causes an error that the filename is too long. This is very bad, and it is not the file that is wrong, it is Stuffit. If you use any other archiving tool, the file decompresses fine (and much faster!).<br />The only reason I give this 2 stars is because it does support a wide variety of formats. However, I'd highly recommend any other products instead of this one. You can even find free archive software for most of these formats.	2003-07-28

At first nI was mad at Intuit for screwing with the product in an apparent attempt to boost their profits by making people an over priced version of what was perfectly fine.  I was ready to send it back under intuit's 60 day money back period, and since I paid $39.98 at Sam's club, I didn't feel too bad at having to pay $64.98 for the Home and Business that would not have the proper schedule C forms that I need. (Mind you Sam's is usually 49.98 & 79.98 respectively).  $15 bucks isn't too bad, but I can tell you with absolute certainty I was not, am not and WILL not pay $104.99 on intuit's website before it went on sale for $74.99, and I won't even pay their 74.99 when I used to pay 39 at Sam's I'd rather look for a new product.  So after I looked at some of the reviews in here, I saw a couple saying that they were upgraded when they called into complain.<br /><br />What did I have to lose, so I gave them a call.  And honestly I really do like doing the taxes via turbotax, and I told &#34;Carlton&#34; that, but that I was very displeased with them changing the abilities of each level.  Not only needing one level higher, but TWO price points.  Carlton was understanding and related that they have been getting a large number of complaints about it and they were indeed upgrading everyone to what they need at no cost because of it.  So, I will give t hem one star back for their understanding, but they will still be dropped three because of the hassle.  And I'm not talking about the 1 hr and 6 minutes that it took to sort out  how to get the upgrade applied, since it failed to keep showing up, in the Intuit account download page.  All was eventually corrected and downloaded and we are ready to go finally.<br /><br />Now granted the back of the boxes do indicated &#34;limited&#34; schedule C activities, they just don't spit it out HOW limited it actually is.  I think it is something like $100 in deductions and no ability to add in self-employeed income.  Unbelieveable, way to piss off your fan base Intuit.  I wonder how much next year you're going to suffer when most of the people who didn't call in will bail to other software.

I bought my PC in 2005, so there was no upgrade path. I had to order the software in order to do the upgrade process. There is nothing wrong with the software I ordered from Amazon. In fact, it was the same as the national leading retailer's, but $16 cheaper. I received it in a timely manner, maybe even before the due date, but I find Windows 8.1 quite different from Windows 7, which I have on a laptop. I'm trying to get used to 8.1, but find it is tedious for me. I don't like it as well as Windows 7, but maybe after awhile I'll grow to like it. If you have older electronics, such as printers, you may find an incompatibility problem with 8.1. I'm not a big fan of it, but maybe some of you who are computer-savvy will enjoy it.	2014-04-19

This is a nice OS.<br />It's faster than XP, Vista, 7 etc. Boot times are lighting quick (SSD)<br />I use the desktop primarily so It's a lot like 7 ... or Vista... or xp but it does seem faster and more responsive than the previous incarnations.<br />I do feel like I'm only utilizing half the OS, and that is the -1 star, but my friend has a full ALL In ONE touchscreen and this OS can do some amazing things. He also hooked up a cam and uses hand commands... it's like watching Tony Stark using his computer. I'd add the star back because of that, but I'm not the one having all the fun so the -1 star stays :P<br /><br />Everyone complaining just does not want to take the time to learn a new system.

It does everything that it says in the description and most things are laid out so that you rarely have to use the help pages.  I found no problems with finished videos or music files, everything played fine on my computer and was a snap to move to DVD for use in the living room (or wherever).  It's not quite as in depth as some of the major brand (and way more expensive) software, but overall, I highly recommend this for the hobbyist.	2013-06-27

We bought the software for a student who has learning disability. When we called the company before the order, they did not mention the software was designed for one time use. By another word, when the student finishes exercise blocks (~20 hours) there is no way for teacher/parent to check how the student did his exercise let alone the same student goes back to practice the second time.<br /><br />We believe learning based on repetitive exercise.

I love QuickBooks and used the free edition that was available for Windows.  However, when I switched to Mac I found this to be a great edition of QuickBooks and outshines the Windows version.  I love the look and feel of QuickBooks for Mac and the floating windows (across the destkop not just within the main QuickBooks window is great!  I have not had any problem using it (I am running OS X 1.8; Mountain Lion).<br /><br />To upgrade from 2012 to 2013 I just uninstalled 2012 (dragged app from Applications folder to Trash and emptied trash).  Then I dragged 2013 from CD to application folder.  I started it and after activating it it stated that it needed to upgrade my 2012 company so I told it OK.  Then a moment later it was up and working and I had no problem.  All of my invoices, estimates, and accounts were there!  I do not notice much difference from 2012 -> 2013, there is a few general GUI improvements, but nothing major!  I was using 2012 in Mountain Lion, so I am not sure what the big difference is, but it works great, and I have not had any problems!<br /><br />In the end I like QuickBooks 2013 for Mac, it is easy to use and works great!  QuickBooks is a name I trust and find it the best way to keep track of invoices and estimates!  It is simple to use and works great with my MacBook Pro (running OS X 10.8 [Mountain Lion]).  I highly recommend!!!!!	2012-11-04

I have used several antivirus and malware packages - Norton, Kaspersky, Mcafee etc. I have never used or installed this product. Norton or Kaspersky charge a lot for adding even one license for existing setup. This product comes with mail in rebate and it is 2 yrs license. So when I had to install BitDefender for someone else's PC, I thought it is great deal we got. Little that I know I was walking into a trap built my Bitdefender(BD). The PC is AMD quad core machine with windows 8.1 and 8GB memory so quiet powerful.<br />I started the install and BD was easy to install. I was able to update, manage privacy settings. Everything was done in about 30 min. The software did put a slight load on machine based on the performance I checked before and after install. But the PC has great power so it was insignificant. I went on to create account on their website and they offered parental controls as an optional tool. This is also a standard for several Antivirus packages. This PC will be used by kids so we decided we'll install parental controls. It required a small package install and setting up the account. When I installed parental controls, it identified two accounts on the windows 8.1 system used by kids. However, it said, it could not find the device(?). This should have been a clue. Then suddenly the PC became extremely slow. A process called 'System' was taking 100% disk i/o. I did not realize but it may have been by BD. I just uninstalled the BD parental control and the speed recovered. However the damage was done as I was going to realize in next 4 hrs. The machine speed was restored after uninstalling BD parental control and I proceeded to do some other work on that system.<br />After that, I found out that google.com is giving 'Certificate error'. Certainly google is not a kind of invalid certificate website. Yahoo was fine. Playing with it, I found that all secure https sites are giving this error. I tried several remedies not suspectingBitdefender. Tried changing clock settings, deleted several cache files, changed IE settings, uninstalled/reinstalled chrome, IE. Read blogs and from what I remember, no one blamed the antivirus for certificate error. I installed Mozilla firefox browser and it worked fine for everything. Then I tried restoring the PC to an earlier date and time. Two attempts to restore failed. However, second time it gave error that a certain file was locked and that was by Bitdefender and that caused the system restoration failure. That was a red flag to me because NO antivirus should mess up with OS standard functionality like restore. That was the clue I thought pointing towards BD for other issue as well. I did not want in uninstall BD so I disabled all BD processes but the certificate error did not resolve. I found that even if you disable startup, turn off BD, kill all BD running processes, somehow an agent and security process by BD still keeps on restarting. But I found out that BD has issues with Firefox and it was working fine for me. So at this point I strongly suspected BD for changing something on my machine that do not let me visit secure websites on IE and chrome. I uninstalled BD. All issues solved.<br />I will not buy this software even free. Yes, the product is easy to install and use but it introduced issues rather than solving them. I am disappointed with BitDefender and hope they fix these issues.	2013-11-18

It is impossible to find out if this problem was unique to my copy of deluxe 2003 or if the program does not print or transmit form 6251 when no amt is due.

When I received the software (3 CD's), I un-installed the 2006 version from my computer which uses Windows XP Professional.(tm)  The installation seemed to go smoothly but when I inserted the third CD, the installation continued and the progress bar was almost complete but after approximately an hour, it was obvious that the installation would not complete so I had to \\"Cancel\\" the installation. There were no virus checkers or TSR programs running in the background so I was puzzled as to why the install would not complete. I called DeLorme's  technical support number ( which is not \\"toll free ) and after a good twenty minute wait finally got a technician on line. We basically tried the installation again but with no success. The technician told me I would have to create a folder on my desktop, copy the three CD's to this folder, then try the installation from the folder and if this didn't work, call them back and let them know any \\"error messages\\" that I encountered.

It is only because I'm knowledgeable about taxes and a software developer that i managed to get my return correct.  And deviation from simply stepping through, one item after another, leads to trouble.  Simply going back, using to back button, to change something can cause important screens to be skipped.   <br /> <br />It is a real disappointment.  Intuit used to be one of the very best software companies. <br /> <br />I certainly don't want to recommend that people by the Microsoft product.  I'm sure one reason Intuit is letting quality drop is the price competition from the convicted monopolist. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to use a tax preparer.	2004-08-04

Just purchased this software to turn my homemade movies into DVDs. The software doesn't recognize my videos downloaded onto the computer because they are in AVI format. I used the free SDcopy software to change them into MPEG format, but the NTI DVD Maker tells me they are now in MPEG-1 format, and they need to be in MPEG-2. In order to convert them into MPEG-2 files I'll need to buy an additional MPEG-2 plug-in from NTI on their website for $15. Now, I'm new to this whole digital video thing and in my naivete I expected the NTI CD/DVD Maker to handle all aspects of DVD burning. Kind of one-click-does-it-all deal. Apparently it does not, and it requires the additional purchase of a video file converter. This is disappointing, and I just started with this software. I'm wondering if there's anything better out there in the market.	2009-01-07

While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.     The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.     The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, \\"You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843.\\"	2008-01-19

They have taken what could have been a good game and ruined it by not paying attention to some basic navigation problems. The cursor indicates that you can move in a direction by showing shoe prints when you hold the cursor over a hot spot. But in this game the hot spots are tiny or in a lot of cases missing. This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch. So I had to keep clicking the screen around her to try to move her out of the way in order to get to the item in question. So unless you have an infinite amount of time and patience, try some other game.	2005-08-21

Software	1	1	2	N	N	Not worth $10.99 or more or less	Like I said this game is not worth $10.99 (never mind if the price goes up), I was (we'll call it) \\"fortunate\\" enough to find this game a t a store that was going out of business for $4. At the time I thought I was the one getting the deal, the game synopsis sounded so interesting as it was based of the popular Italian Comic Book: Martin Mystère, a Professor of Art History, Archaeologist, Anthropologist (Basically an Italianized version of Indiana Jones who lives in New York ) is called to assist the New York Police Department in investigating the death of long time friend, Professor Eulemberg, prominent archaeologist who's latest top secret reserch lays theory for the three bullet wounds currently residing in his chest.  See, interesting right? Well, the cool looking box and the news clips and envelope containing a final word from the dearly departed are where the coolness comes to a halt. The game is played in a third person POV and is basically a point and click, inventory type game. It becomes very tedious after a while, mostly because it takes forever to get Martin from one side of the room to another. The mouse never seems to take you where you want to go.As Martin walks the colors seem to pull across the screen leaving an annoying streak of color.The cut screens aren't any better, they take forever to load and tend to freeze your computer from time to time. More than once during this game is required to restart due to freezing issues. Also there is no real rhyme or reason to this game it just sort of goes on and on. There's no sort of hints or any type of direction to get you from point A to point B in the game. In order for me to get through this game with any sense of sanity left over I was required to find Internet help. (I know you're probably wondering why I didn't stop playing the game if it was this tedious and boring. Strangely enough even though was boring I wanted to see how this game ended.) Surprisingly enough there are plenty of people out therewho have found a way through this game and were kind enough to share with all of us. If you're the type of person who can sit from the computer for hours on end just pointing and clicking adding things to your inventory endlessly then I cannot recommend a better game, but if you are looking for a game with more entertainment value and a lot less boring I strongly recommend anything but this. I found it to not be worth my time or my money; because trust me when I finally got to the end of the game and I saw how the game ended, I could not believe I had spent 14 hours of my life clicking away endlessly at the screen. This game is not even worth it.  Martin Mystere: Operation Dorian Gray was released as Martin Mystere: Crime Stories in the North America region. Please do not be confused into thinking that these are two separate games.	2011-08-22

On the other hand, my computer is perfect since I installed it and after-all that's the biggest PLUS feature of all, so I'm very happy with that.<br />Works great with Windows 7 and has a low foot print for CPU usage unless you do a deep scan and then it tends to bog down some.

Sadly it took me 55 minutes on hold for anyone to pick up, however if your in trouble at least someone is there to help you that understands what to do.

I've passed difficult certification exams thanks to this true method of learning.  I find this method a difficult but sure way to learn.  Professor Teaches is a respected, strong brand in computer training.     I got frustrated during the incredibly long installation.  First, the steps of the installation were so long that I started to suspect problems with the CD.  The program hung up to the extent that I couldn't even get Task Manager up. I had to eject the CD and abort installation.  Therefore, I decided that since installation is such an ordeal, I'd install and use only one tutorial at a time.  That was a disappointment until I realized that each tutorial could have been a separate program, and each tutorial has a distinct subject.    I started with Word 2010.  Sure enough, I found that I didn't know the program as well as I thought.  There are lots of basic things even an experienced user can learn.  If you want to learn Word or learn it better, I recommend this tutorial.    There are tutorials on the Office 2010 suite, even advanced tutorials on Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  There are also tutorials on Windows 7, one for each of the four versions.  Note, for a lot of people there might be no reason to install more than two tutorials for Windows 7.  Most of us would install the Windows 7 version on our computer and probably the advanced tutorial for that version too.    I recommend this software with the warning to be prepared for the problematic installation and to install only the tutorials you're likely to use.	2010-10-16

If you are already using a version of Quickbooks make sure it can be converted & opened in the new software.

Attempting to open an older PC Quickbooks file (by old I mean the 2006 version) and it could not open it. After further looking into it, the only way to make it work is to find some running the 2008 Quickbooks PC (and convert my old file to 2008 and then to Mac) or find someone running an older version of Quickbooks Mac or of course buying the new PC version as well. Having someone else (that has the new 2008 Quickbooks PC) opening & converting financial information isn't always a comforting thought.

However, TurboTax continues to rapidly increase the price and decrease the content each year to the point that it is now time to look at other similar programs.  This year the TurboTax site shows the home and business version for $99 and this does not include a state tax that runs another $30.  Compare that to Amazons price of $72 which includes the state.  Last year TurboTax tried to jack up the cost by playing with the number and cost of the e filings.

He's probably ecstatic that his picture is no longer on the box. His products (guides and tools) were the staple of system maintenace until he sold his company to Symantec. The products have been going downhill since. <br /> <br />Anyone who buys this product better have a PhD in Windows registry editing and patience beyond the belief. You will need a reliable internet connection to download all the \\"extra\\" tools you will need to try to remove it (or any previous version of SystemsWorks), none of which worked on my system (at this point I was told to reinstall IE6 by Symantec support - give me a break). Their own product, WinDoctor, which you can run from the CD, apparently does nothing to remove their own registry entries. It never could remove some reference to Norton Utilies, which was not longer on my system - I had to remove them manually from the registry. <br /> <br />If you try to install it too many times (for example because you are having unistallation problems with the previous version), you will be greeted with a message telling you that cannot activate it. This requires you to mail in your CD, receipts, etc and wait at least 3 weeks for a new copy (if they decide to give you one). <br /> <br />This is the saddest example of a commercial product I believe I have ever seen. So, as I have seen in many other reviews \\"DON\\"T BUY IT!\\" You'll be sorry.	2006-05-03

Agreeably, this is the cheapest GPS system that you can get/use if you already have a laptop. But before you buy it, keep in mind extra bucks for car adapter for your laptop or a DC-AC converter, so you can use the Laptop/GPS uninterrupted on long drives. <br /> <br />So you get what you pay for, using a laptop while driving is definitely painful if you are driving alone. Plus the size of the laptop and using it in the car is definitely not easy. <br /> <br />I have used it on couple of my long drives, the software is pretty good but the maps starts blinking when you enter a downtown, which is really confusing and distrubing while driving in downtown. It does not automatically recalculate route ,if you miss your way, which is another pain.... <br /> <br />During my Ohio trip last month, the USB adapter broker, believe me, the adapter is very weak and can;t take any pressure on it while plugged to the laptop. Now I am not able to use the GPS with the maps. And unfortunately the USB adapter is not available/sold separately anywhere.  <br /> <br />So finally I would say spending another 100 odd dollars would buy you a garmin i3/c320 or tomtom one which would be much more worth your money and save you all the trouble with this worthless product.  <br /> <br />I was happy using it in the beginning as it was my first GPS system but very soon I have noticed all the difficulty/pain/troubles in using this system which is why I can say the price tag on those compact GPS systems is totally justified.. I am going to get those compact ones for myself soon, before my next trip.. <br />	2007-05-08

The image quality on this disc is great and all the stories are there with ads and all and it's just like reading it straight from the book. It's also great because you get all of the Amazing series comics for about the same price as one or two TPBs, though if you want to read complete stories from arcs that spanned across other series, like Maximum Carnage, then you'll have to buy a few TPBs anyway.  All in all this collection is very good and I can now say that I own every single Amazing Spider-Man comic that has been released since Amazing Fantasy 15.	2008-01-16

I have found 3D Home Architect to be a fairly good program for a novice CAD user.<br />As some of the reviews here have noted, the program is not as intuitive as it might otherwise have been; the 3D rendering could be A LOT faster; and I found the User Guide to have some errors (some of which were corrected on the website as technical notes.

I purchased the Total Protection Suite and began using the data protection and backup feature.  When I wanted to restore my data, it was all GONE!!  I contacted McAfee and tried the backup again.  The amount of data keeps changing.  I specified 1.4GB of data to back up, but if I accessed a file that I did not want to back up, McAfee software changed the amount of data to include that file and all other files in that particular category - several times putting me over the 2GB limit without my knowing it.  No warning - no nothing.  Then, McAfee cut me off from being able to access my files - no warning, no nothing.<br />So, I started to use Amazon Cloud Drive instead.  It works fabulously!!  Far better than McAfee backup.<br /><br />Now, McAfee recently updated their software and I've had nothing but problems for days.  I spent over half a day on online chat with technicians the other day trying to fix the problems.  It took out my Internet Explorer, my access to AOL, damaged Firefox, and messed up my operating system, not to mention how slow it normally is.  After fixing all of that with the help of the techs, today McAfee crashed and froze Windows.  After rebooting I got an error message about the McAfee crash.<br /><br />Something's very wrong with McAfee these days.  After having been a loyal McAfee customer for over 10 years, I am sorry that I feel it necessary to warn people about this product.	2011-05-06

The program easily upgraded from my Q98  files with no problems what so ever.  The new layout is very user friendly  and the quick graphs are a nice touch.<br />As a person who only has a couple  of bank accounts and no securities, Quicken Basic is the perfect tool.   It's a great way to balance your checkbook and avoid common errors in  simple math.  The graphs are a neat feature and I find it helpful to be  able to categorize and chart my expenses.<br />I really like the on-line  display that you can set up.  Quicken has a feature will it will let you  upload the balances of your accounts to their web page for easy viewing  anywhere you have net access.  <br />The one problem I have with Q01 is that  the on-line banking (at least with the credit card I had) was not  automatic.  You have to go to the cc's web site and download the Quicken  format file in from the web site into your quicken folder.  <br />Overall, if  anyone is looking for a new money management program, I would highly  recommend the Quicken series.  Unless you have a 401(k) or a lot of stocks  and bonds, the Basic program is more than you will ever need.  With respect  to upgrading, I did not see a huge differnce from Q98 to Q01, outside of  the new web-like format.  The register and reconciliation was virtually the  same.  So, unless you need to get Y2K compliant, I'd just keep the old  version of Quicken.	2000-09-14

Generally I've been very pleased with the performance of Trends software and found it to be a nice compromise of security and machine performance. I recently had the chance to try Titanium Internet Security 11 for my HP laptop running Windows 7. Previously I had Norton Internet Security 11, however, this was only a 3 month subscription that came with my laptop.<br /><br />In direct comparison to Symantec's Norton Internet Security suite, Trend falls short in a few key areas. The major letdown is the amount of options that have been removed from Trends interface. In previous versions Trend allowed a high-level of user customization including network settings, firewall settings, customized scans and more. Titanium has gone a different direction and seems geared toward simplicity and automation. That's fine for some users but folks used to tweaking their security software to fit specific needs will be disappointed. I found Norton to be much more customizable and offered a deeper range of customization and help options for advanced settings.<br /><br />In a performance comparison Norton did a fantastic job blocking suspicious sites and pop-ups. I've noticed that Trend has missed several sites that Norton would always catch. Scan times are similar and both Norton and Trend offer \\"quick or full\\" scans. I feel that Norton did a better job surmising at the end of the scan what had been found, what had been fixed and what the vulnerabilities are on the system. Both software suites completed scans on about 50gb of data in about 20min.<br /><br />Installation of Titanium on a Windows 7 machine was smooth and all told took about 15-20min including downloading the first update (major). No complaints here.<br /><br />In summation if you're interested in install and forget software then Titanium is made just for you. If you're an advanced user or someone who's more curious and wants to tweak some settings then pass on Titanium.then pass on Titanium.	2011-03-02

The product is a pretty good product, not very expensive, and customizable.  I just purchased ACT! 2011 yesterday and have returned it today.    Sage is a horrible company to deal with!  They push you in circles when you call for customer support.  There will be a reason you have to contact customer support at some point in time....leave at least 2 hours in your schedule when you contact them.  This was the third time I had an issue and each time took 2 hours to correct a simple issue.  I don't care that I had to call, but I care that they obviously push people in circles and put them on hold for 20 minutes in hopes that they will hang up. Chat representatives take several minutes to respond to everything you type and phone reps are impossible to understand, unless you call the sales department which is obviously located in the United States.  2 hours of your time is worth more than the price of this product.    Beware of this before you purchase.  There are other CRM programs out there that offer better customer service.  Any product is only as good as the company behind it.  I no longer support Sage since they moved their customer service overseas.  Just be warned before purchasing this product.	2010-11-01

For quite a while, AV makers were forcing you to pay for every PC you wished to protect. For some of us, that got pretty expensive, pretty fast and it was a pain to have to find an appropriate version for OS X that mirrored the capabilities of the Windows software.<br /><br />With McAfee All Access, you enter the supplied code, set up an account on their web site and can immediately get the freshest version available.<br />This is a nice change from the usual model of security software where you are supplied with a disc that's so far out of date that you have to go back and upgrade what you just installed. That makes the entire process much simpler and much less painful.<br /><br />Once loaded, the software did a decent job staying out of the way, but I did notice significant CPU use while running the full scan. I've learned to schedule those so the system has time to chew through all of my files while I sleep rather than trying to compete with it while it's working.<br /><br />Overall, I like the new direction McAfee's going with their AV software and I've protected all of my systems with it.	2012-11-28

He wants to be a video game designer when he grows up and from the reviews we read this would be a great starting point, but by no means a professional tool for selling your own games.<br /><br />We selected Animae Studio Pro 8 because it was more user friendly than what a lot of other programs seemed to offer. There are a LOT of free tutorials online, through YouTube, and trouble shooting tips all over google's search engine. He managed to pick up basics in just a few days and created a short in about a week. Overall he said it was cool, but he wanted more details and less work... seems to be consistent with the reviews in the past. I would say for the price, this is a good starting point for animators and those who think they would like to learn animation.	2013-04-09

This is the third or fourth version of Street Atlas USA Handheld I've bought. On each of the prior occasions I gave up trying to use it with a variety of PDAs. One more time I thought since DeLorme boasted of the major revision they'd made.<br /><br />  Not really. It is still a stinkeroo.<br /><br />  It installs easily to a Palm device and earlier versions installed easily to Windows CE. And it works nicely with a non-DeLorme Blutetooth GPS.<br /><br />  But it is useless on a PDA. Maps are shown in 2D view only and they are simply thin lines across the screen. Street names even in the optional large font size are still unreadable unless you focus intensely. The highest zoom setting still covers too much area while the lowest zoom settings result in such crowded data that your route is lost.<br /><br />  The second weakest feature is trying to find a location. DeLorme forces you through a convoluted procedure. And finding an address seems to take forever.<br /><br />  The absolute worst feature is trying to create a route on the PDA. It is frustrating, time consuming and, in my experience, almost never works.<br /><br />  Finally, DeLorme's map information is incorrect and doesn't seem to be updated. The 2004 version didn't note that the street I live on is one-way and it constantly routed me going the wrong way. It sill does.<br /><br />  Actually using the product is a nightmare. The representation of your GPS location on the Palm TX's 320 x 480 screen is so tiny as to be invisible, virtually impossible to quickly see in a moving vehicle. Not a good situation. The display does not stay centered. One moment your GPS locator is squarely in the center of the screen. The next, it is at the top of the screen. Then the bottom or the sides. There is no uniformity.<br /><br />  The product allows you to set waypoints in order to customize your route. You literally have to do that on the computer rather than the PDA, because the PDA maps are simply too cumbersome to work with. You can do a reverse route on the PDA. Wouldn't you expect that if you simply reverse the route you created, that the waypoints you inserted would be considered? Logic says yes; DeLorme says no. Recalculating a route took almost 15 minutes on the Palm and resulted in a hodgepodge of side streets being included. Since I didn't follow the recommended (and very strange) reverse route, the program simply stopped posting the GPS location to the map. Apparently if you aren't following a pre-determined route, you are out of luck.<br /><br />  I'm finished with DeLorme. Never again.<br /><br />Jerryect that if you simply reverse the route you created, that the waypoints you inserted would be considered? Logic says yes; DeLorme says no.

First the disclamiers:<br /><br />1) I am not an accountant, but then again I have done my own taxes (personal, business,S-Corp and LLC, rentals, etc.) for the last 22 years. AND I must recommend, when you do that, pay an Accountant for an hour's worth of his time to review your returns. You may be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />2) I also purchased  TurboTax 2014 Deluxe. I got really ticked off when I realized you couldn't do Sched D and Sched E's on that like prior years. So I returned that last month and gave Intuit a one-star rating! Then I purchased H&R Block's Premier.<br /><br />Low and behold, Intuit saw all the negative feedback and JUST RECENTLY came back with an apology and a free upgrade to Premier version that does all of that. Now we are almost same price as H&R Block's. Excellent.<br /><br />Now here comes  the low down on H&R Block's Premier.<br /><br />It readily imports from your prior year Turbotax. No worries. And it also does a good job on walking you thru like TurbTax product, similar user interfaces (though a bit cruder), but  it does the job. It also does a good job on calculating your charitable donation item valuations.<br /><br />Here's the problem! Look back on your professionally prepared returns of your prior years. If you have a business or a partnership with a K-1, and you have un-reimbursed partner Expenses (UPE), it falls flat on its face! Instead of taking the deduction on Sched E and reducing your self Employment taxes, it shoves it onto form 2106, and takes the deduction on you itemized expenses. So what? This would cost me an additional $2500-$3500 in extra taxes (your results may vary).<br /><br />So I called the support line and after an almost two hour wait, they opened a ticket and told me to call back. I did so 3  weeks later, same wait time. But Gee Wiz, ticket was closed. Long story short, no help, no explanation, no resolution, nada. I posted the issue on Amazon product Q&A and no one else had an answer.<br /><br />The moral of this story is, if you have a simple return to do, H&R Block's software would probably do just fine and save you ten bucks over TurboTax. All the rest of you be worried, be VERY worried!	2015-02-07

I am a huge fan of CSI and I was so excited when I picked this up at Target.  It was fun trying to find all of the evidence and figure out who committed the crime and everything, but there were a couple major glitches that happened the entire game. One was the fact that any time there was a close-up of a character, then it was just a giant white box where the person should've been sitting.  That was really annoying because you couldn't see anything around them.  Another glitch was in the last case of the first disk, no matter what location I went to, it always looked like the suspect's apartment...and Catherine was always floating in the air.  That meant that I couldn't see any of the evidence that was supposed to be at that location because it always looked like the apartment that I had already searched.  The second disk was a little bit better, but it still had its little glitches...like suddenly talking in a foreign language.<br /><br />All in all, it was fun, but I'm happy I didn't spend any more money on it than I did.	2010-06-07

SO I uninstalled Nero using Windows XP's add/remove programs, and I reset the system to the last checkpoint before installing Nero. But the audio driver is still not working. I'll have to purchase and install a new sound card with new software- not that costly, but a serious drag.  Note that Nero does NOT offer free technical support. (They charge $1.29 per minute, with no guarantee of resolution. Thus it could well be cheaper, in the end, for me to just purchase a new sound card for $20, rather than enriching Nero, which in my view is undeserving.)  Thus, I strongly caution you NOT to purchase any Nero products UNLESS your retailer offers free technical support for it OR you are a very advanced techie. If you are an ordinary user/consumer, use at your own risk.	2009-06-30

I had hope for Windows 10 after hearing people say &#34;it's just like windows 7 it's awesome&#34; my hope was quickly destroyed as soon as I clicked on the &#34;amazing&#34; new start button. You basically have the ugly, useless tile screen from windows 8 put into a box on your desktop, not a true start menu. The start menu is made up of stupid, useless, ugly tile start screen apps, all apps list and if you scroll all the way to the bottom of the list you will find programs and accessories which is the only thing that should be there in the first place. Microsoft needs to give up on the stupid useless, app garbage on desktops. The search bar next to the &#34;start menu&#34; is laggy and brings up web search results etc. even if you simply search for a file on your pc, the relocation of simple features/settings is dumb and hiding things behind app style Windows 8 junk is not cool. Cortana sucks, again the search is laggy and to even use it you need to basically let the program monitor your every move and keystroke. Microsoft used to pride itself on respecting users privacy....as you may have guessed by reading the revised versions of their user agreement they sent out prior to releasing Windows 10 that is no longer the case. Windows 10 will track your every move or click, apps can read every message or conversation and data mine your entire PC in every nook and cranny. If you don’t believe it check out the settings on any program you open and see for yourself. You will now see notifications, news stories and ads on your lock screen (what is this a damn phone) and every time you launch the new edge browser you will get MSN top stories/ads. There are literally a hundred options you need to turn off to not have your every click tracked and sent to Microsoft and advertisers...even if you turn them off they are still on in another menu somewhere else, do you understand why it's free...more like freemium. The new edge browser simply sucks compared to any other browsers out there including internet explorer. When you launch edge it gives you an infinite scrolling screen of MSN news and ads that you cannot turn off, at least I cannot find a way to do it, with a search bar saying &#34;where to next&#34; where you can do a web search with bing. I wanted to change my web search to Yahoo but it required going to yahoo.com then opening then new edge menu bar, and adding it then setting it to default, users on windows 7/8 will have trouble with this as it can be very tricky to find. I didn't find many positives with edge, it loads up fast but what’s the use when you have an a fraction of the options and customizations you have with any other browser and the fact that Edge doesn’t support a lot of websites hence why Windows 10 still has Internet Explorer tucked away. I can draw on the web page I’m looking at....whoopee, it's the app version of internet explorer on Windows 8 with Microsoft paint integration. The OS feels more like a phone than ever before. If you boot up windows 8.1 then took a windows phone and laid it on the bottom left corner of a pc monitor screen you have Windows 10. It almost runs like an advertising tool for Microsoft to sell you useless crap via tiles and notifications popping up. I tried running my games that I was running fine on Windows 8.1/7 and there are many issues and graphics issues. Some games like Borderlands/Borderlands 2 have major graphic issues now where bushes and bullets look like paint blotches splattered on the screen no matter how much you play with the video options. Dead Island, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Light will not work at all, they simply crash when launched so I’m wondering if my ATI Radeon card is having windows 10 update issues that were in the news recently where windows 10 update will override the drivers installed by your graphics card suite causing crashes, graphical problems and infinite restarts. Again I had hopes that Microsoft would actually deliver a quality product like Windows 7 but instead we get a lazy freemium version of windows 8.1 that rivals google it terms of disgusting spying/data stealing for profit. Windows 10 is &#34;freemium&#34; not free, you pay for it by giving up every ounce of privacy for Microsoft’s financial benefit. I’m glad that I switched to OSX again a few months back and only use windows on my secondary computer, I won’t be putting this garbage on my mac. If you do upgrade the first thing you should do is go into every settings menu you can find and check the privacy options, you will still be data mined just not as badly. You will have to do this more than once as there are for example two control panels....named the same but both with their own privacy settings. The split personality of Windows 8 is back in full effect . In short Windows 10 is just Windows 8.1 freemium edition, you even still have to right click the start menu to get control panel (one of them) and stuff quickly because if you traditionally left click on it, it wil just shows you apps and useless tile garbage, basically the Windows 8 start screen in a box instead of desktop features and shortcuts to things you actually need. Windows 10 is a total failure, the people claiming it to be Windows Christ are simply dreaming or paid to say so, stick to windows 7/8.1. Windows 10 is nothing like Windows 7, try it first on an old computer if you are curious. If you hate Windows 8, Windows 10 will not improve anything, you will still be using the same failed phone/pc hybrid operating system but you will have to give up ALL your privacy for nothing you can't do on windows 7/8.1. Apparently you will also be paying for games like solitaire (1.49 a month) and 14.99 for a dvd/blue ray player software. Hopefully anyone can see where this is going. I also noticed a 5 star rating for Windows 10 as all the negative reviews are no longer being counted for some reason.....<br /><br />Interesting to note:<br /><br />How can users trust Microsoft when Windows 10 is nothing but SPYWARE?

Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.<br /><br />This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.<br /><br />TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.<br /><br />The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).<br /><br />NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.<br /><br />I will update this review as I continue to use the product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Price includes federal E-File<br />* Overall, probably the best tax program there is<br />* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)<br />* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1<br />* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition<br />* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?<br />* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets<br />* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements<br />* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.<br /><br />WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):<br /><br />* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)<br />* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)& Business edition<br />* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?<br />* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets<br />* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements<br />* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.<br /><br />WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):<br /><br />* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)<br />* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)	2014-01-20

As has been previously pointed out, Poser 6 seems to have been designed by a committee of people..that did not much like each other. <br />The user interface is pretty terrible. It seriously needs revamping to a more Windows-like format. <br /> <br />The cration of figures yields very good results on the other hand, although additional content can run into big bucks. Be warned. <br /> <br />My biggest beef with Poser 6 is with applying clothing to the model. It is ludicrously hard to do. It is TEDIOUS to the point of suicidal depression. There has GOT to be a better way.  <br />Actually... there is a better way: placing the artical of clothing in position , the \\"shrink-wrapping\\" it around the figure, using the polys of thye figure itself as a guide. I do not have the coding skills to write such a sub-routine myself, but there are plenty of people that do. <br /> <br />Poser 7 is supposed to be coming out this year right in time for Xmas. I REALLY hope efrontiers is not doing a rush job on getting Poser 7 out in time. That was done with Poser 5 when it was released and proved a serious botch job. Poser 6 is only a marginal improvement over it's predecessor. I am hoping 7 will be a REAL improvement. <br /> <br />What the program REALLY needs is a complete, top-to-bottom redesign; from scratch. What we have actually seen so far is new versions of the same old thing; a patch, on a patch, on a patch.	2006-10-17

Site Server and it's big sister ECommerce Edition do just about everything any website wants to do. These facilities include Personalisation and Membership, Content Deployment, Searching Multiple Websites and File Locations, Personalised Direct Mailings and a Knowledge Management application. It has a full set of analysis tools that are easy to use and produce useful information and not just pretty pictures. <br />Standard Site Server is primarily aimed at intranet solutions but can be equally easily used for non-ecommerce applications. It would be fair to say that it is complete overkill for many intranet solutions unless you use the direct mailing to staff or want to create a centralised document store of some form. It is not, however, aimed at being a complete document management solution. However, most people have now realised that websites or intranets and just another communication media for your staff or client community and so this product is useful for second generation sites that want to go the extra mile.<br />A lot of the database work is aimed towards SQL Server but the documentation in both Microsoft manuals and third-party books on proper SQL integration is sketchy or contains errata. The product is also so complex that you have to read every line of the Wrox books to make sure you don't make mistakes.<br />Securing your site under NT also create its problems. Part of that is the underlying NT OS and a significant section is the sheer scale of the product. Wrox books on P&amp;M have some information on securing LDAP servers etc., but I have yet to see a 'bible' on security covering this product in particular and IIS in general.<br />Microsoft also seem to have no upgrade pricing when moving from Site Server to ECommerce Edition so carefully evaluate whether to spend the extra money now on ECommerce. It is easy not to activate the commerce pipelines until you are ready.<br />To summarise, implementing this product can scale to a major undertaking but the payback on a correctly implemented site is worth the effort.	2000-10-06

Called quickbooks for upgrade.  Quickbook representative said the upgrade would cost additional $100. This was fine.  She told be me that their system is not allowing them to charge $100 for upgrade and she must charge full $395+tax and refund the $295+tax.  I agreed to this since I will be paying only $100 after the refund.  She advised that i should get the refund within 3-5 days.<br /><br />This is where all the problem started.  I called in when the refund was not issued after 5 days.  Intuit, suddenly, says the refund will be issued after 7-10 business days.  They even gave me the refund confirmation number.  Then, I totally forgot about this and only remembered when i got my credit card statement.  Called again for an update.  They don't even have the refund confirmation number in their system.  The new representative told me that she will look deeper in to this matter and call me within 7-10 days later.  I decided to hell with intuit and called my credit card company to dispute the charge.<br /><br />First of all, refund process does not take 3-5, 7-10 days.  It takes 1 day max.  Secondly, their ignorance is just making me irate.<br />I've been intuit customer for 10 years and purchased the quickbooks 5 times within this period. I am fed up trying to get back what is mine.	2012-09-19

After reading all the reviews I decided to give my take on new ver 12. I have and still use ver 7 on an old celeron computer running Windows ME. I run ver 8 on a 2.6 pentium computer running Windows XP Pro. I built a new machine a couple months ago running a AMD 4400+ X2 running Windows XP Pro. I found that ver 12 installed with no problems and in no more then 15 minutes. I did what was instructed and had closed all other running programs during the install. I also created a restore point using system restore in case there were problems. After installing I took it for a fun test drive. After playing with it, and loving it. I will say that for a regular grandpa that takes hundreds of photos a year of the grandkids. This is one wonderful piece of software. I am using a 19\\" Samsung model 906BW LCD monior with the resolution set a the factory recommend 1440X900. No trouble seeing the screen. Using a EVGA 7600 video card with 256mb ram. The computer itself has 2Gb Kingston HyperX PC 3200 DDR. Because some reviewers said the program loaded slowly when opened. I turned on that machine and after it booted I opened the program and timed it. 17 seconds. Yes seconds. So I can only imagine that the ones having trouble with the way the program loads must have a lot of other stuff running at the same time. It took only seconds also to save a picture that I cropped, removed redeye. and resized before saving. With earlier vers I have been able to do some wonderful things to old B&W photos taken back in the early 40's of my father during WWII as well as my mother and older brother and sister. I'm sure this new ver with only make playing around that more fun. If you are new to photo editing I believe you will not be unhappy buying this. The other reason I purchased it was I'll be building another new computer as soon as service pack 1 is released for Windows Visa. And this ver with run under Vista.	2007-11-09

I'm not sure if people are just not computer savvy, or what the problem is.  The first time I used windows 8, I had no problems at all.  It functions like good ole windows 7, XP, or the other windows- just updated.  If you are lost, try the windows hard key on your keyboard, or mouse over the right side of the screen to bring up the start menu.  And the upgrade to windows 8.1 now shows a windows menu in the bottom left like you are used to.  I'm still using the windows key on the keyboard, but it's there if I wanted it.  I've used Android, WebOS, linux- they all are pretty easy to use.  New Windows 8 feels like a nice hybrid of Windows and Android or similar software with the GUI.<br /><br />All the complainers who don't want to figure out a new simple updated interface are the reason why Apple is taking over the market.  If Windows trys to do something new, the uninformed, old fashioned and lazy masses don't want to learn how to mouse to the right instead of clicking on the left and so they whine and send Microsoft back to try to appease them.  I wish people would quit being babies and learn something new.  They should try to advance with technology, or just shut up and go back to using a fax machine.	2014-01-05

I bought Rosetta to try it out and I love it. I never like to go to classroom and want to learn or practice a language in my terms. But most of the self learning tools misses one thing. You need somebody to listen you and correct your conversation since talking is the most important part of the language. Speech recognition tool is awesome. I have always problem with some words in German and Rosetta can point it out and forces me to say it right. Each time I make a mistake I listen the speaker more carefully to get it right and i do it..Of course it can not be 100% perfect, but we should give a credit to Rosetta for this feature that nobody has it. I have no idea how they really do it :) I really do not agree with all other negative reviews. I think problem comes from personal differences. Not everybody is very talented to learn a language..I know some people who can start to speak a language by just studying Rosetta..yet I know some people who can never learn a language. I am in between so I study more and also use other techniques. And of course you always have to read other stuff to learn new vocabulary. You can never learn all vocabulary in one Rosetta program or even in your language class..Language learning takes some effort..And I don't think Rosetta is expensive, this is an investment and you can keep it forever and use it whenever you need it..Good job Rosetta	2009-03-13

The bundle of applications included in this suite is actually very usable for photo and video beginners: VideoStudio Express for video editing, PaintShop Photo Express for performing basic one-click-does-it-all sorts of photo editing, WinDVD for playing DVDs and videos, DVD Factory for burning DVDs, and Instant Viewer photo viewer/browser.<br /><br />For photo or video beginners, I rate this collection of applications that is oriented towards spoon-fed ease of use 4 stars.  However, my main reservation (no restaurant pun intended) to this collection of software is that if you are either an intermediate or (especially) advanced user of photo or video editing software, or if you are a beginning user of this software who wants to progress into advanced \\"power user\\" levels of features, you will soon hit a wall with the limited set of tools and functionality that the VideoStudio Express and PaintShop Photo Express, in particular, provide.<br /><br />If you foresee yourself diving more into advanced both photo and video editing capabilities, I would skip a bundle like this and head straight for the higher learning curve, and likewise higher ability, of Adobe Photoshop Elements or even Corel's own CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 is far more powerful, albeit more expensive.  But in a way, the \\"you get what you pay for\\" law still applies here.  There are likewise far better video editing software out there, both commercial and free.  But as a beginner-level package for people who either are less literate with using software or do not care to tinker too much with their photos and videos, this is a pretty good and useful bundle.this is a pretty good and useful bundle.	2009-12-22

At least, that's what I thought when trying to install this on two computers with the OS of Windows 98 SE. It literally destroyed one of them, ruining the OS and a hard drive. The other computer didn't suffer to such an extreme, but suffered nonetheless.<br />However, when I decided to give Symantec one last chance I attempted to install it on a computer of mine with XP Home loaded on it. And much to my surprise, IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY! Thinking it might have just been luck, I installed it on my fourth computer in the house, which was running on XP Home, and it worked without a flaw!<br />The fact that it was unreliable on the other OS's, and the damage it could total, drops this excellent program (on XP Home, for me at least) down to 3 stars (I'd have to say rounded up from middle 2's for the damage it did).<br />Buy with caution.	2004-05-02

This is for those of you who aren't sure whether this game is compatible with Windows 7. I have a brand new HP with windows 7 and I recently bought Scrabble Champion Edition. It works great with no problems. However, my previous full screen Scrabble does not work with it. The Champion Edition uses only about 2/3 of the screen with player information on the other 3rd. Much prefer my board to be full screen, but apparently am stuck with this visually less pleasing version, which again, does work fine.	2010-11-17

There are a couple of things that I would like to see changed though<br /><br />1- I didn't like the synthetic voice. I couldn't get it loud enough to hear over my radio. A solution is to hockup one of those signal transmitters and listen to the audio through your car radio. I havn't tried it yet but I will soon<br /><br />2- When I'm off route, The program didn't try to calculate another route unless I'm closer to a new exit in the street that the one I missed.

It gives you access to the Microsoft app store and has a very streamlined Metro approach for quick use and for when you don't want to go indepth on your desktop.<br /><br />There is a learning curve when picking up this product but it's very short and if you are just competent with other windows OS's then it will be very short.<br /><br />The potential for this product is great it will in the future be a staple to entertainment. The reason I say this is because of the integration that is OS gives you with your Xbox, Windows 8 Phones and Surface tablets, it will be unparalleled.<br /><br />Microsoft took a big risk with this product but it turned out great.<br /><br />Zach	2012-10-30

This is a rental property add on to on the Quicken base product which was not designed with any significant input from experienced rental property owners.  Not enough functionality.  One size fits none.  You can easily get where you need using multiple income and expense categories in Quicken.  The deposit liability account is pointless.  Lease expiration information can be better (should be) maintained in Outlook or your standard calendar function.  What the program doesn't get you, Excel can make up the difference in about 5 minutes.  Also, the program doesn't want to open the Quicken data base from time to time, but always gets it on the second time. My 2010 version of Quicken never did that. Makes me nervous.  I wish I could get my money back, but Quicken doesn't offer the information in or on the product packaging so you'll have to search their website for the details.  I tried that but it will cost me 5x more in lost time looking for that than the amount of the refund.  Of course you can always deal with the outsourced customer care center in India.  12/09/2016 follow up.  To add insult to injury, once your Quicken data is formatted for use with Quicken Rental Property Manager - you can never go back with that data file to another Quicken Product - you have to stay with Quicken Rental Property Manager - or start over.

I did a clean installation on all of them. I had no problem with drivers except on MacBook build in mouse pad but all I had to do was run driver pack for Bootcamp and it was all good.     Stability:   Actually I have been running Windows 7 Ultimate Beta from 2008 Dec. It's so hard to explain how stable the OS was even at Beta stage. Hands down Windows 7 is way more stable than Vista and XP. Even on my netbook is running full version of Windows 7 Professional with all the features. Start up and Shutdown time is much faster than before. I always loved gadgets in Vista but it so memory hogging; I never used it, but Windows 7 gadgets perform memory efficiently and can easily be move around. The wake up from sleep and hibernation is much faster now and this is a hug time saver on my laptop and netbook.    My Favorite Features:    Task Bar  I love the new task bar. This is very efficient; I have access to all my favorite programs with one click and no matter how many instances I am running, it is still not cluttered. I can also navigate quickly to the right window with sneak peak and close down if I don't want that window. And if your programs support jump list then you can go to your last worked document in two clicks. Also window snap is a life saver. It's so easy to transfer files from one window to another now or to compare documents/files.     Homegroup  Wow, this is a breeze now. You would love this if you have more than one computer. It's so simple to add a new computer or create a new homegroup. You can share your files or devices between computers so seamlessly and so much faster. What makes this even better is what's called Libraries in Windows 7. I will give a good example on this. I have lots of movies and videos. As you know average video file ofa TV program is about good 700MB. So I have all my videos on my separate hard drive on my desktop. With homegroup I can have this hard drive to share and then on my laptop I can add this drive on the desktop as a path in my video Library. This saves tons of space on my netbook and laptop. I can have access to any file I want in other computer but it doesn't even feel like it's in a separate computer because libraries put all your files to one place no matter where the data is. You have to try this out to see how efficient things can get and how easy and seamless it is now. Setting up all this was only couple of clicks. It's the same if you have devices that you want to share.     Windows Media Player and Media Center  Now it supports more Codecs. This is something most people don't know about new media player; it has some awesome streaming features. If you have Windows 7 compatible devices such as another PC or a TV you can stream music to the device. I can start watching a movie in my desktop, then if I feel like to finish watching the movie in bed I just stream it to the laptop and watch in the bed. I find this awesome and it doesn't stop there. If you a have Windows Live ID you can assign this account to your profile on your Desktop and access and play music from your laptop anywhere with internet. So indirectly it acts as a media server :D. New Media Center has lots of partners there for you can watch almost all your favorite TV programs on your PC (CBS, The CW MSN, MSNBC, NETFLIX, showtime).     Explorer 8  I am a big fan of Firefox. But I have been using explorer more often now and it's my default browser. Most sites load fast as Firefox. But explorer itself launch faster than Firefox. Tabs are multi-threaded now so if one tab crashes it doesn't bring down all my tabs. And I have to say it hasn't crashed on my only few times, on times it has crashed I copied and pasted the link on Firefox and my Firefox crashed as well. So there is not much difference there. Ilike how I can control all add-ons in new explorer from one place. If a search add-on is not therefore your favorite site you can simply create your own in 30 seconds. accelerators also make it more efficient, i dont have to type to look up things (maps, words - dictionary). Also I find InPrivate brower pretty useful ;).    Search  Search has evolved from Vista. It's even faster now and it doesn't hog your computer when it indexing. If you install some filters like Foxit PDF IFilter it truly shines and makes your life much easier.    Finally, i have to say 64 bit is something you can live with now. Its not a hassel to find drivers or programs anymore. i managed to install all programs i run on my 32bit to work on 64bit with no effort.    Tip: If you are a college student you will get hug discount, also check if you school is part of MSDN acadamic, if it is you can get free copy of Windows 7. :D if any of the above doesnt apply to you, you can always get an OEM copy which is cheaper    Recommended Free Programs  Live Mesh - Sync files between computers (I use Live Mesh to sync my documents and pics but use Live Sync to sync my large files, this way you won't waste your online storage on Mesh).

(For a long list of its deficiencies, see the reviews - and one star rating - of [[ASIN:B003YJ5E0K Quicken Essentials for Mac]] here on Amazon - basically it's Accounting Lite and not a real program for adults with complicated finances.)<br /><br />I had looked into prior versions of IBank but had been put off by its lack of comprehensive reporting features.  This past weekend I was delighted to learn IBank 4 now has customize-able reporting.  You can report on only one payee or category, or virtually any combination of accounts.<br /><br />Although, in a sense I won't need reports as often - you can search by Payee, Category, or virtually any keyword in the main Document window for each account, and then see all your transactions.  EDIT:  I had said in the first draft of this review that you can't search for keywords across accounts but just now I stumbled upon the solution:  If you put your active accounts into a Group (mine is called '2011 Credit Cards'), then enter a keyword in that Group window view - all of the transactions in any of that Group's accounts containing the keyword will pop right up in a list.  I had also thought you couldn't search using numbers but that is also incorrect - I had just been going about it the wrong way.  You absolutely can search for numbers in your accounts, either individually or by group, which is incredibly helpful if you reconcile by hand as I do...mystery transactions containing amounts like \\"12.87\\" or \\"5.34\\" are instantly available once entered in one of the search windows.)  These search windows also make finding Payees and whatever you've written in the blissfully-not-truncated Notes field very easy.  The search is instant, as opposed to the slow, clunky, single-transaction view offered by Quicken 2007.<br /><br />There are a couple of features in IBank 4 that make me nearly weep with relief after my struggles with Quicken 2007.  Firstly, you can CUT AND PASTE TRANSACTIONS!!!!  It's so wonderful!!  How many times have I spent hours trying to remove mistakenly-downloaded transactions from one of my accounts in Quicken.  (If you accidentally import or your bank accidentally downloads transactions into the wrong account or re-downloads transactions, you could have hundreds of bad transactions that will take you literally hours to remove in Quicken 2007.  Quicken 2007 won't allow you to select more than one transaction for deletion - ever; contains \\"are you sure\\" type prompts you can't turn off any time you try to delete a transaction; and contains no deletion-related keyboard shortcuts.  It makes a tedious task, hitting an \\"are you sure you want to delete this: OK\\" button dozens, or hundreds, of times to remove error-filled transactions.)  Of course, you could always restore your Quicken file from a backup you made before the bad data was entered, but then you'd also lose any other (good) changes you had made since that backup was created.<br /><br />Quicken also will only allow the user to move transactions one-at-a-time between accounts...again, with no multiple transaction selection or keyboard shortcuts allowed.  In IBank 4 deleting and moving multiple transactions takes literally seconds.  Actually, it's so easy one worries about mistakenly altering something.  Fortunately, the inclusion of an \\"UNDO [last action]\\" (coupled with \\"REDO\\") option in the Edit menu prevents disaster.  You can also export your transactions to QIF or TXF format, or back them up whenever you like.  Additionally, you can set up IBank 4 to back up your transactions whenever you quit the program.  This means restoring from backup is an option here too.<br /><br />Another vastly improved area over Quicken is the use of Categories in IBank 4.  It's basically the same methodology - you use different Categories (Grocery, Restaurants, Books), but again you have a lotmore flexibility.  When I migrated over to IBank 4 I was able to reassign transactions with ease - IBank 4 will let you reassign current transactions to a new category if you decide to delete one of the old ones.  Also, it's easier not to mistakenly re-create similarly named categories (mine are always 'Grocery' and 'Groceries') with IBank's easy pull-down window which autopopulates when you start typing.  IBank's IPhone client (IBank Mobile) also helps create uniform Payees and Categories - no more variations on a business name and street address for the same location, since you use the same Categories and Payees for both versions of IBank.  My better, more accurate reports are going to come in handy at tax time.<br /><br />IBank Mobile is a piece of cake as well.  Your data syncs with one click - in seconds and error free, creating a mirror copy of your desktop software.  (This feature alone, which allowed me to ditch the various other IPhone apps I had cobbled together to use with Quicken, is worth the cost of admission.)  It's the end of the year, I have three thousand or so transactions that I exported out of Quicken and imported to IBank 4 (which was a smooth, near-totally bug-free process, I might add).  IBank Mobile imported them all in literally seconds, after the simple syncing setup between my IPhone and MacBookPro.  It's going to be SO NICE not to have to use the IPhone Checkbook app to export each account manually to an email (which is not secure), then re-import by hand to Quicken 2007.<br /><br />My jury's still mildly out - this product runs so quickly and is so easy to use that it's making me paranoid whether all my transaction data is still there - but as of now I have to say, I'm completely, utterly thrilled with IBank 4.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars but it still has a little bit of functionality left to add.  I'd like to see the developers add Class functionality (which is basically a way to sort Categories by subcategory).  To some extent there's a workaround for this - you can simply add another Category as a subcategory of the one you're working with - but you can't then sort those subcategories independently.  I had been using the Class capability in Quicken to track the different sales taxes I pay on various products, but I think for now I'm going to have to manually split transactions to track the sales tax.  I'd like an easier, automatic way to do this, but for now I don't think that's available in either IBank 4 or Quicken 2007.  This is a big deal for me, because I live in a state with VERY high sales tax and I need to track it for deduction on my Federal returns.  (I buy things occasionally from outlets that don't charge sales tax, so I can't just apply x.xx% to every transaction to get my total; also, my state has a different sales tax rate for groceries and other incidentals.)<br /><br />Note:  I don't use my software to print checks or to download transactions from my bank (I'd really rather reconcile my accounts by hand, which means I can review each transaction more thoroughly).  However, I tried importing some transactions just to see how it worked, and again - smooth, easy, crash-free.<br /><br />[UPDATE, 11/30/10]:  Apparently there's a way to integrate IBank 4 with Turbotax, through exporting your transactions into a specific format. To use this I assume you need to assign Categories to various portions of the tax code, and use that to generate your export.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this product, and I'm even more happy that it's currently being actively supported.  Intuit has sent clear signals that it isn't taking Mac users' needs seriously, while IGG Software is actively soliciting input from users for further added features for IBank.  So far, it's been well worth the money not have to spend so much hands-on time managing my finances, and correcting the errors Quicken 2007 kept baking into my accounts.  Thanks IGG!!<br /><br />[UPDATE, 12/3/10]: After having completely migrated my finances and used the product for a few days, I have more details.  First, this program is staggering in what it does well - the reporting features are fast and comprehensive; I can see the 'big picture' of my finances at a glance, which is quite an unusual feeling for me.  ;)  I'm really happy with features like the automatic 'Scheduled Transactions' and the ability to add them to ICal.<br /><br />On the downside, to some extent you can tell this is a program being developed by independent software programmers and not a gigantic corporate conglomerate like Intuit.  It's got a couple of glitches - I had some trouble creating a Category in the IPhone client and so far I've had a couple of 'hangs' requiring me to hard-reset the program.<br /><br />However - and this is a big however - nothing I've found so far has resulted in any data loss what-so-ever.  I've now experimented with exporting and importing data from my backups, and I'm convinced this is not something I'm going to have to keep in the forefront of my mind.<br /><br />So yes, it's not quite 100% in terms of stability, but in terms of functionality it's so far ahead of Quicken 2007 it's not even funny.<br /><br />One other feature I'd like to see added is the ability to see one's Budget in the IPhone client (but you can see your account totals in real time if you've synced your phone; you can even see your running totals by Category).  Obviously this is a minor quibble - Quicken doesn't even have an IPhone client.<br /><br />IGG is running a software forum where you can report issues with the program and put in feature requests.  So far I've found the developers responsive and quite reasonable.<br /><br />I'm more than prepared to recommend this software package to all comers.

For years now, people have been asking me about Linux - how hard is it to learn?  When will it be easy enough for a &quot;non-techie&quot; to use?  My answer, as of Red Hat 8+ is pretty much - now.<br />If you use your PC to play on the web, &quot;do&quot; email, and use &quot;Office&quot;-type applications, it's probably easier these days doing so on Linux than on Windows XP.  Go read the reviews of XP on this web site!  The way they throw around acronyms: NTFS, ASPI, Microsoft &quot;Product Activation&quot; (&quot;Dear Microsoft, is it okay for me to use my computer now?&quot;)... Red Hat 9.0 installs with a fairly simple and intuitive wizard.  You can (the easiest way) decide to run only Linux on your machine, or, if you have a bit more technical acumen, you can run both Linux and Windows on the same machine (switching between the two by rebooting). <br />Some people are put off by the command-line interface in Linux (looks like DOS), but honestly, how often do you use DOS on your Windows system?  Just like windows, everything can be done by clicking on an icon.  Red Hat 9.0 ships with a graphical inteface called &quot;Bluecurve&quot; that looks and works VERY similarly to MS Windows - &quot;Start&quot; button, taskbar, icons on desktop - and puts everything near your fingertips.<br />Red Hat also comes with Mozilla (a web browser very similar to Netscape), Evolution (an Outlook-like email client and personal scheduling program), OpenOffice.org (a MS Office XP replacement that reads and WRITES your MS Word, MS Excel, and MS Powerpoint documents), and about 1400 other games and applications.  Other standouts include GnuCash, the Linux version of Quicken, the Tux Racer game - if you haven't played it yet, there's demos for all operating systems on it's web site - suitable for all ages, and KStars, the desktop planetarium, and did I mention about 1400 other games and applications?<br />P.S. I'm guessing that with the recent Microsoft Blaster worm (and Slammer, and Nimda, and... ), the points about security risks in using Microsoft products - as opposed to Linux - is well made.  *cough*	2003-09-05

I needed a less expensive alternative to Adobe InDesign and I was hoping this product fit the bill.  I was put somewhat at ease by the other customer reviews, but I was also a little afraid that their recommendations were slightly biased.  I wondered, could this program put out professional documents?    I can tell you, yes it can.  I am a graphic design student and am required to work with Adobe products.  I needed a product that was not as expensive as InDesign but could still give professional results.      Keep in mind, this is not Adobe InDesign.  You wont find the higher end tools that you get in InDesign, but to be perfectly honest, you probably wont even need them.  Even so, I could not believe all that this product offers.  What I received far outweighed my expectations.  I have had this product for only a short time, but I can confidently say that this is a good product, well designed, easy to use, and very professional.      I am very, very impressed with this product.  It is well worth what I spent on it.  If you buy this, I can just about guarantee that you will not be dissapointed.	2010-02-23

I will not correct any errors that may come along during the transcription. What do I think about this program? It has learned my voice and generally works well in spelling correctly things I dictate. My problem with the program is what it does not do, particularly in comparison with the Dragon speech program. In Dragon speech I am able to dictate in programs such as WordPerfect and Word and without touching the keyboard I can save the file and print the document. I have not been able to do this with the MacSpeech Dictate program. If the program is capable of doing this, then the documentation is woefully inadequate for showing the user how to do some of these things. If the program is not capable of doing this, the question is why not?    For me the value of  software lies in how well it does little things as well as the big things.  wife certainly enjoy-that did not come out right.

Further use lowers rating to one and a half stars	I just switched to an IMac for my home computer. On my work desktop and my work laptop I operate in a Windows/Office environment. My review concentrates on how easy and compatible this version is to use compared to the Windows version of Office. It is some 10 years since I used a Mac regularly so I am readjusting to the Mac but the issues I raise here are to do with software and not my Mac, which i really enjoy using.<br /><br />I tried to register my new very legit copy of Office 2008 for Mac online copy but my product number was not recognized. Mmmm. Ok at least it works.<br /><br />As others have mentioned you can not drag images across and have them reproduce. So tables from web pages get messed up in Entourage emails. But Apple's Mail program will do this.<br /><br />Likewise images from web pages have to be copied to the desk top and then moved to powerpoint.<br /><br />This home/student edition has no Exchange support so my calendar will sync down from the server but not up from my Mac. Since my work place already shells out big bucks to Microsoft, as do many education institutions whose staff members will want to use this product at home a little exchange support on this cheaper copy may have been good PR. As it stands we are being punished for either not paying a lot more for a tiny extra feature, or for daring to leave the Windows regime.<br /><br />And as others have noted the lack of Visual Basic means End Notes is not usable.<br /><br />[And today I tried to open a PDF file received through Entourage and it would not open. The error message read the file was damaged. When i opened Mail and tried to open the file it opened. I had the same problem last week and put it down to the file not Entourage, or should that be Enter a Rage? My rating is now down one star. January 25, 2008. But today after I received a word document and it would not open I further examined the issue and realized that there is a tiny message in the header of emails with attachments telling you the whole message has not been downloaded. Click on the get entire message and then save the attachment and it will open. I assume this procedure is a security feature of some sort but it does seem over cumbersome. Is this feature a way of Microsoft getting back at those Mac ads mocking PCs for needing so many warning messages and the like when attaching peripherals? So rating back up half a star because you can open attachments but poor guidance about how to do so. January 27, 2008.]<br /><br />Also what is the use of putting MS Messenger on the disc when it is: a. free to download and b. does not come with audio and video?! Microsoft may as well have included a free plastic toy because this is like a cereal give away gimmick only the toy would have been more useful and fun.<br /><br />I get the feeling that maybe I should have bought Office 2004.<br /><br />I needed this product since my work place has a site license for Windows versions but not Mac versions I had to buy it. But I think that I will probably not get the next version, but rather buy a Mac laptop, subscribe to .Mac, and consign my work computer to the storeroom (or try to get a Mac) and switch to the Apple software that came with my Mac, so that I do not have to work around all these issues.loaded.

If  this isn't fast, what is? ActiveX controls, DLL libraries and using  Microsoft's ADO data control system is very easy to use.<br />I thought Visual  C++ 5 was good, but I do enjoy seeing a list of possible functions and  attributes that you are associated with objects when you type the name of  the object in your class related source files. The package is much better  integrated for web development.<br />Overall, excellent package	2000-02-19

They say that they do not understand my problem.  No wonder they have no understanding of the English language.  When Scansoft ran the show it was fantastic, now if you have to rely on Tech. Support the software goes from 5 star to a  1 star.  It really makes me angry because when it runs properly it handles my document storage very well.  They should train Tech Support or go out of business.  Presently it will not install thus it is useless.	2014-03-01

Recently it was acquired by another company.  Their first edition since acquiring the previous company was filled with misleading information.  Buyer Beware and ask a TON of questions before purchasing this software or anything newer.  You do not receive payroll, even though you think you are getting payroll.  Payroll is an EXTRA expense.  EVERYTHING is an extra expense.  Talking to support = EXTRA, Downloading updates = EXTRA.    Ok so this is not the prettiest of reviews.  The software is easy to use and besides changes to the look and where it is located, it has remained the same.  They continue to ad features to an accounting system, that is wonderful for some, but quite frankly, we just need it to do accounting and PAYROLL.  If it weren't for them charging and forcing us to upgrade we would probably still be using MYOB 3 from 1995.	2011-09-03
